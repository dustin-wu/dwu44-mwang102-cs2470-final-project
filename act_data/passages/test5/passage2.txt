The Sargasso Sea is a part of the northern Atlantic Ocean.

As  the  Crame r  idles  through  the  S argas so  Sea, waiting  for  the  wind  to  rise,  the  
sea  is  flat  and  empty. Nothing  demarcates  or  divides  the  smooth  expanse  of water  
dissolving  into  the  horizon.  This  vast,  unroughened  surface,  this  breadth  of  uniform  sea, deceives.  But for  a  few  lonely  oceanic  
islands,  the  unperturbed  sur- face  offers  no  hint  of  the  grand  and  sweeping  energies 
hidden  below.
Only  one thousand  miles  offshore,  the Cramer  has
 already   sailed   through   some   of   Atlantic’s   deepest waters.  Contrary  to  what  one 
 might  guess,  Atlantic’s deepest  waters, like those in other oceans,  are along her edges.  As  
we  continue  east,  toward  the  middle  of  the sea, the bottom  rises. The unmarked  plains of  
the abyss,
here flattened  by  layers  of  sediment,  give  way  to  rising foothills  and   then  to  
mountains.  The  first  maps  of Atlantic  seafloor  noted,  albeit  crudely,  this  rise.  Early 
efforts  to  plumb  Atlantic’s  depths  proved  outrageously inaccurate:  one  naval  officer  paid 
 out  eight  miles  (thir-
teen  kilometers)  of  hemp  rope  from  a drifting  ship  and concluded  the  sea  had  no  
bottom.  Eventually,  sailors more  or  less  successfully  calculated  depth  by  heaving 
overboard  cannonballs  tied  to bailing  twine.  When  they hit  bottom,  the  sailors  measured  
and  snipped  the  twine
and  then  moved  on,  leaving  a  trail  of  lead  strung  out across  the seafloor.  These 
crude soundings, forming  the basis  of  the  first  map  of  Atlantic’s  basin,  published  in 
1854,  identified   a  prominent   rise  halfway   between Europe and America.

         For  many  years  no  one  could  explain   why  the basin  of  Atlantic,  unlike  a  
bowl,  deepened  at  its  edges and  shoaled  in  its  center.  People  assumed   that  this 
“Middle  Ground,”  “Telegraph  Plateau,”  or  “Dolphin Rise,”  as  it  was  variously  called,  was 
 an  ancient  and
drowned  land  bridge,  or  a  lost  continent,  but  sailors repairing  trans atlantic  
telegraph  cable  unknowingly produced  evidence  to  prove  otherwise.  Wrestling  with the  
broken  cable,  they  accidentally  twisted  off  a  piece of  the  “plateau”  and  dredged  up  a  
twenty-one-pound
(ten-kilogram)  chunk  of  dense  black  volcanic  rock.  It was some of  the youngest,  
freshest rock on earth, and  it was torn  not from a piece of  continent  sunk beneath  the waves,  
but from the very foundation  of  the sea.
Today,  highly  sophisticated  sound  waves  bring  the
hazy  images  of  those  early  soundings  into  sharp  focus, revealing  that  one  of  the  
largest  and  most  salient  geo- graphic  features  on  the  planet  lies  on  the  floor  ot  the 
ocean.  Hidden  beneath  the  waves  is  an  immense  sub- merged  mountain  range,  the  backbone  
of  the sea. More
extensive,  rugged,  and  imposing  than  the  Andes,  Rock- ies,  or  Himalayas,  it  covers  
almost  as  much  of  earth's surface  as  the  dry  land  of  continents.  Winding  like  the seam 
 of  a  baseball,  it circles  the  planet  in  a  long,  sinuous  path, running  the entire length  of  Atlantic,  slashing the  basin  neatly  in  two.  Its  
mountains  are  stark  and black,  as  black  as  the  sea  itself,  lit  only  at  their  peaks by 
a thin, patchy covering of  white, the skeletal remains of  tiny  microscopic  animals  that  once  
lived  at  the  sur- face.  Peaks  as  high  as Mount  St. Helens  sit in  a  watery
world of  blackness,  more than  a mile below  the surface, beyond  the reach of  light, beyond 
 the sight of  sailors.

A  great  valley,  eclipsing  any  comparable  feature on  dry  land,  runs  through  these  
mountains.  Arizona's Grand  Canyon,  one  of  earth's  most  spectacular  places,
extends  for  about  280 miles  (450 kilometers).  A lesser- known  canyon  of  similar  depth  
but considerably  greater length   lies   hidden   in   the   mountains   of   the   ridge. 
Although  offset  in  many  places  by  breaks  in  the  moun- tains, the rift valley, as the 
canyon  is called, extends  the
length  of  Atlantic for 11,000 miles  (17,700 kilometers). Here  in  this  bleak  and  
forbidding   place,  where  the water  is  almost  freezing,  subterranean  fires  have  lifted 
mounds  of  fresh lava  onto  the seafloor.  Scientists  visit- ing  the  rift  valley  for  the  
first  time  named  the  volcanic
hills  in  this  otherworldly  setting  after  distant,  lifeless planets.

Yet,  what  had  seemed  so foreign  to scientists  is an integral  part  of  earth's  very  being, 
 for  at  the  ridge  our own  planet  gives  birth.  The  floor  of  the  rift  valley  is
torn;  from  the  gashes  has  sprung  the  seafloor  underly- ing all of  Atlantic. Here the 
youngest,  newest pieces are made.  Earth  is  still  cooling  from  her  tumultuous  birth four 
and a half  billion  years ago. Heat, leaking from  the molten  core and from  radioactive  decay  
deep inside the
planet, rises toward  earth's  surface,  powering  the volca- noes that deliver the ridge to 
the sea.
