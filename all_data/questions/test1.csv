   The passage is written from the point of  view of:,"   an  unidentified  narrator  observing  the  relationship over time between  a boy and his 
grandfather.","    two members  of  the same  family  discovering  their shared  trait through  joint 
activities.","   a  grown  man  agonizing  over  the  mixed  messages he received  as a child from older 
relatives.",   a  boy  and  the  man  he  becomes  considering  inci- dents that illustrate a family trait.,D,1
"  Which  of  the  following  best  describes  the  author's approach  to  presenting  the  story  
of  the  narrator's  dis- covery  about himself?","    Revealing  the  narrator's  self-awareness  about  a trait  through  a  blend  of  personal  
reflection  and scenes from  the narrator's  youth and adulthood","   Starting  immediately  with  a  statement  of  the  dis- covery  in  the  narrator's  voice  
and continuing  with scenes that reveal how the discovery came about","   Describing  the physical  details  of  scenes  and  sum- marizing  their  significance  in  a  
concluding  state- ment in the narrator's  voice","     Using dialogue in the midst  of  scenes fraught  with tension  to  indicate  what  the  
narrator  is  experi- encing internally",A,1
  Each  of  the  three  projects  described  in  the  passage reveals:,   the increasing  antagonism  between  the grandfather and grandson.,    the  errors  the  narrator  makes  and  the  disapproval they bring from others.,    that  such  incidents  set  the  stage  for  the  Bryant family traits to emerge.,"   that  the  narrator  is  determined  to  avoid  being ungrateful,  hateful,  or overly 
fastidious.",C,1
"  The boy's approach  to the task of  converting  the tennis court to a basketball  court can 
best be described  as:",    reluctant until his grandfather's  plans inspire him.,   enthusiastic  until  his grandfather's  error  puts  them both in an awkward  position.,   apprehensive  until  he  discovers  his  error  is  not  a devastating  one.,     thrilled  until  he  remembers  that  his  grandfather  is a poor planner.,B,1
"   As  he  is  revealed  in  the  incident  of  undertaking  the construction  of  the  
basketball  court,  the  grandfather can best be characterized  as:","   confidently  optimistic,  then childishly  defensive.","   charmingly  patient, then increasingly  accusatory.",   consistently  encouraging  in spite of setbacks.,"   vocally  defensive,  then quietly  apologetic.

"   The  question  “Did  you  know  that  Bryant  built  his shelves  so they  tilt?”  (lines  
65-66)  helps establish  that the narrator is anxious  because:","    his  coworkers  have  discovered  his  incompetence and have made it the subject of office 
humor.",   his coworkers  resent his having  a corner office and punish him with their biting humor.,"   he  fears  his  incompetence  is  so  glaring  it  will make him the object of ridicule among 
coworkers.","     the  tilting  bookshelves  remind  him  that,  like  his grandfather,  he cannot hide his 
mistakes.",C,1
"   Information  in  the  second  paragraph  (lines  4—12) reveals  that  the  family's  response  
to  the  grandfather's error with the crutches is to:",   find a workable  remedy for it.,   lay the blame on  the narrator.,   praise him for more successful  projects.,   fix what wasn't wrong in the first place.,A,1
"   It can most  reasonably  be inferred  from  the sixth  para- graph  (lines  36-46)  that  the  
statement  that  the  basket- ball hoops “can't be made smaller”  (line 40) is:",    a fact stated  by the grandfather  apologetically.,   an opinion stated by the grandfather indignantly.,   a claim the narrator  makes  to humiliate a relative.,     a conclusion  the narrator reaches after hard labor.,B,1
"   It  can  most  reasonably  be  inferred  that  the  narrator's discovery  that  an  error  has 
 been  made  in  constructing the bookshelves  is for him a source of:",   embarrassment  in the face of coworkers  who antic- ipated it.,   comfort  because  it  reveals  a  trait  that  he  shares with his family.,   frustration  because  it  will  require  a  remedy  that will be tedious to carry out.,"   relief  because  it  gives  him  an  excuse  to  seek  the assistance of coworkers  in 
finishing the project.",B,1
"  In  the  last  paragraph,  a  comparison  is  made  between “diminished  excellence”  and  
“flawed  competence.” From  the  narrator's  point  of  view,  the  conditions  are different 
because  the one is:",    a  source  of  sorrow  while  the  other  is  a  source  of pride.,"   based  in  the family  while  the other is  based  in  the
self.",   inherent  in  the  environment  while  the  other  is inherent in the individual.,"     a  sign  that  the  individual  can  improve  the  world while the other is a sign that the 
individual can't.",C,1
  The  function  of  the  first  paragraph  in  relation  to  the passage  as a whole is to:,"   orient  the  reader  to  the  subject  of  longitude  by explaining  how longitude  is 
determined  at sea.","   explain  the  political  significance  of  developing  an accurate way  of  determining  
longitude.","   establish  that  longitude  calculations  are  necessary to determine  time in  two different  
places at once.","   introduce a discussion  of  how knowledge  of  Earth's pos iti on  rel at i ve  to  the  Sun  
was  gained  in  the process of  advances in timekeeping.",A,2
"  Which of  the following  best describes  the way the fifth paragraph  (lines  48-54)  
functions  in  the  passage  as  a whole?","    It  puts  into  historical  perspective  the  difficulty  of solving  the  longitude  problem 
 and  introduces  the subject of  Britain's longitude prize.","   It  translates  the  technical  terminology  used  else- where  in  the  passage  into  
language  that  is  more widely  understood.","   It  sheds  light  on  why  it  took  longer  for  a  solution to the longitude  problem  to 
emerge  in Europe  than in other parts of  the world.","     It diminishes  the importance  of  the lives that were lost in the efforts to solve the 
longitude  problem.",A,2
"  It  can  reasonably  be  inferred  from  the  passage  that before  Harrison's  efforts,  other  
individuals  trying  to solve the longitude problem  had failed  to:",   consider  clocks  as  the  potential  instrument  of  cal- culation.,"   agree  on  why  longitude  decreases  in  value  at increasing  distances from Earth's 
equator.",   improve  upon  the  features  of  clocks  that  made them unreliable  at sea.,"   understand  the  ways  that  charts  and  compasses could  be  used  in  connection  with  
timepieces  to calculate longitude.",C,2
"  The reference  to the catastrophe  at Scilly  (lines 45-47) is used to illustrate the point 
made in the passage that:",    charts  and  compasses  were  poorly  made  in  the 1700s.,"   England  more  than  other  countries  stood  to  gain from a solution  to the problem  of  
determining  lon- gitude.","   captains  were  contributing  to  the  problem  of  lost lives  by  resisting  a  solution  to 
 the  problem  of determining  longitude.","     Harrison's  accomplishments  addressed  shortcom- ings  of  navigation  whose  consequences  
were  vast in scale.",D,2
"  Information  in  the  second  paragraph  (lines  17-25) establishes  that one degree  of  
longitude  translates  into a distance of:",   sixty-eight  miles  at  Earth's  equator  but  less  on either side of  Earth's equator.,   sixty-eight  miles  at  Earth's  equator  but  more  on either side of  Earth's equator.,   one thousand  miles  the world over.,"   virtually  nothing at Earth's equator, increasing  to a maximum  of sixty-eight  miles at the 
poles.",A,2
  Which  of  the  following  statements  best  describes  the metals  used in Harrison's clock?,"    The  metals  were  identical  so  that  they  would respond  consistently  to  changes  in  
conditions  at sea.","   The  metals  were  different  so  that  their  changes  in response  to  conditions  at  sea  
would  counteract each other.","   The  metals  that  remained  stable  in  response  to temperature  changes  were  encased  in  
metals  that were impervious  to rust.","     The  metals  expanded  and  contracted  in  ways  that were counteracted  by changes  in the 
parts made of wood.",B,2
"  The  passage  suggests  that  Harrison's  principal  com- petitors  in  the  race  to develop  
a means  of  determining longitude  were:",   the great captains in the Age of  Exploration.,   members  of  the British Parliament.,    trained  clockmakers  with formal educations.,   individuals  in the scientific community.,D,2
"  According  to  the  passage,  there  was  a  delay  between the  time  when  Harrison  arrived 
 at  a  solution  to  the problem  of  longitude  and  when  he received  his  reward because  his:",    invention  predated  the Longitude  Act of 1714.,   clock  was  only  one  of  many  successful  solutions to emerge simultaneously.,   opponents  obstructed  his efforts  to claim  the  prize money.,"     supporters  abandoned  him  in  order  to  exploit  his invention  for their own financial 
gain.",C,2
  Lines  82-84  indicate  that  others  took  over  Harrison's work in order to:,"   secure  a  wider  range  of  applications  for  an  instru- ment that had been used only at 
sea.",    take credit for his remarkable  accomplishments.,   diminish  the significance  of  his  clock  by  having  it mass-produced.,   turn  his  design  into  one  that  could  be  practically produced  for more users.,D,2
  The  passage  indicates  that  instruments  for determining longitude  now include:,    modified  pendulum  clocks.,   satellites.,   a network  of ships.,     barometers.,B,2
"  As  it  is  described  in  the  passage,  sewing  seems  most closely  associated  in  the  
narrator's  mind  with  her mother's:",   low wages.,   compassion.,   self-worth.,   thriftiness.,C,3
"  It is  reasonable  to infer  from  the  passage  that  the nar- rator looks back on the 
dinner-dances  as a time when:",   her  parents  were  in  conflict  over  her  mother's work.,   the  entire  family  was  filled  with  excitement  and anticipation.,   she  and  her  father  had  a  much  easier  relationship with each other.,    her  mother  and  father  had  renewed  hope  for  the future of the family.,B,3
"  It  is  reasonable  to  infer  that  the  primary  reason  the author  included  the  
information  in  the  eleventh  para- graph (lines 59—64) is to:","   contrast it with the earlier description  of the family looking at shop displays on a snowy 
evening.","   support  the information  about  the trip to the fabric store, which is presented  earlier.",   compare  it with  the  scene  where  the father  dances with his wife and daughters.,   contrast  it with  the scene presented  in the last  two paragraphs  (lines 78—92).,A,3
  The primary focus of lines 65-92 is:,   the  relationship  between  the  narrator  and  her mother.,   Okaa-chan's  strength and integrity.,   Albany's move toward  the twenty-first century.,    the narrator's father's stubbornness.,B,3
"  When  the  narrator  says,  “I  solemnly  would  nod—the honored  recipient  of  this  arcane  
cultural  wisdom” (lines 53—54), she most likely means that:",   she felt intimidated  when her father was giving her information that she did not understand.,   her father was honored  to be able to share personal information  with his daughter.,"   when  her father  put on his tie, she pretended  to be honored,  even  though  she  thought  
his  comment was silly.",   the information  her father  was  giving  her  seemed important  and made her feel valued.,D,3
"  The sentence “Like an eagle, her words slipped regally down  a  great  distance  and  struck  
with  awful  ease” (lines 75—76)  indicates that the narrator:",    was not sure what her mother expected  of her.,   recognized  that her mother was being demeaned.,   wanted to distance herself from her mother.,     was ill at ease with her position in the family.,B,3
"  Information  in  the passage  suggests  that  the narrator's father  disapproves  of  
Okaa-chan's  sewing  business primarily  because it:",   diminishes his role as a provider.,   means more to her than he does.,   does not generate enough income.,   threatens his sense of dignity.,D,3
"  Based on  the last two  paragraphs  (lines  78-92),  which of  the  following  statements  
indicates  what  the  nar- rator's father and mother have in common?",   They  both want control of the family finances.,   They are both fighting for their self-respect.,   They  both want to teach a lesson to their children.,    They  are  both  angry  at  the  woman  who  came  for the fitting.,B,3
  The  author  uses  the  term  “architectural  wonders” (line 12) to describe:,   nineteenth-century buildings.,   German  baked goods.,   crowded city blocks with cobblestone  streets.,"   arranged layers of fruits, vegetables,  and sausages.",D,3
"  Which  of  the  following  words  best  describes  the  nar- rator's  father's  dancing  as  
he  practices  for  the dinner- dance with Okaa-chan?",    Skillful,   Graceful,   Clumsy,     Indifferent,C,3
"  The quotation  by L. S. Vygotsky  in lines 32-41 is  used in  this  passage to support  the 
idea that:","   children  with  handicaps  should  be  studied  in  the same  way  as  children  defined  by  
physicians  as “normal.”",   deficits  need  to  demonstrate  intactness  in  order  to be judged acceptable.,    neural  or  sensory  mishap  occurs  in  children  as well as in adults.,"   development  of  children  with  handicaps  may  pro- ceed in positive  yet quite distinctive  
ways.",D,4
"  The  author  of  the  passage  refers  to  the  work  of  A.  R. Luria  and  L.  S.  Vygotsky  
primarily  to  underscore  the idea that people  who have:",    disabilities  or  developmental  disorders  learn  to create new selves.,   disabilities  or  developmental  disorders  need  spe- cial  treatment.,   unusual handicaps  are qualitatively  different.,     neural  mishaps have minutely  differentiated brains.,A,4
"  Lines 42—53 suggest that, prior to A. R. Luria's research, medical researchers  had thought of 
the brain as:",   dynamic.,    unchanging.,   paradoxical.,   creative.,B,4
"  As  it  is  used  in  line  41,  the  word  compensation  most nearly  means:",    payment.,   differentiation.,   disposition.,     adaptation.,D,4
  The author's  main purpose in lines 54-69 is to show:,   how  he  has  come  to  think  differently  about  the brain.,   why sickness  often causes a contraction  of life.,   when  he  had  made  new  discoveries  about  the brain.,   which  of  his subjects  helped  him redefine  the term “norm.”,A,4
"  The  author  of  the  passage  makes  it  clear  that,  when  it comes  to  understanding  the 
 effects  of  a  disease  on  an individual  patient,  it  is  necessary  for  medical  doctors to:",    adhere  to established  norms  of  human  behavior  in diagnosing and treating  disease.,"   quickly  establish  a  method  of  treatment  that  will save the patient from further 
suffering.",   examine  the  ways  that  people  learn  to  live  with  a disease in their daily lives.,"     know  each  person's  brain  is  minutely  differenti- ated and responsible for the disease 
being studied.",C,4
"  The  last  paragraph  suggests  that  the  author's  main reason for leaving  the hospital  to 
visit his patients is to allow him to:",   feel more like a patient than a physician.,    become a more important  part of  the real world.,   understand his patients'  illnesses  better.,   see if being a naturalist  is like being a physician.,C,4
"  The  paradox  mentioned  in  the  second  paragraph (lines 9—14) is best described  by which 
of the following statements?","    The  course  of  human  evolution  is  guided  by  the creative potential of  the static 
brain.","   Serious  illness  can  lead  directly  to  previously unthought of yet productive  
developmental  change.","   Sickness  may  contract  life,  but  in  so  doing  it  can maintain  the physical  “norm” at 
a similar level.","     The  long-term  study  of  disorders  and  diseases brings out the creative skills of 
researchers.",B,4
"  As  it  is  used  in  line  15,  the  word  ravages  most  nearly means:",   paradoxical features.,   creative adaptations.,   fatal nature.,   destructive actions.,D,4
  The word miracle  in line 52 refers  most specifically  to the ways in which:,    brain function  disorders  are cured.,   unique handicaps  are compensated  for.,   different areas of the brain  work together.,     the creative potential of disease is revealed.,C,4
