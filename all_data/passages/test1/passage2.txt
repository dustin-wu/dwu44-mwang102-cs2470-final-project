To learn  one's  longitude  at sea, one needs  to know what  time  it  is  aboard  ship  and  also  
the  time  at  the home  port or another  place of  known  longitude—at  that very  same  moment.  
The  two  clock  times  enable  the
navigator  to  convert  the  hour  difference  into  a  geo- graphical  separation.  Since  the  
Earth  takes  twenty-four hours  to  complete  one  full  revolution  of  three  hundred sixty  
degrees,  one  hour  marks  one  twenty-fourth  of  a spin, or fifteen  degrees.  And  so each  
hour’ s time difference  between  the  ship  and  the  starting  point  marks  a progress  of  fifteen  degrees  
of  longitude  to  the  east  or west.  Every  day  at  sea,  when  the  navigator  resets  the 
ship’ s  clock  to  local  noon  when  the  sun  reache s  its highest  point  in  the  sky,  and  
then  consults  the  home-
port  cloc k,  every  hour’ s  discrepanc y  between  them translates  into another fifteen 
degrees of  longitude.

Those  same  fifteen  degrees  of  longitude  also  cor- respond  to  a  distance  traveled.  At  
the  Equator,  where the girth of  the Earth  is greatest,  fifteen  degrees  stretch
fully  one  thousand  miles.  North  or  south  of  that  line, however,  the  mileage  value  
of  each  degree  decreases. One  degree  of  longitude  equals  four  minutes  of  time the  world 
 over,  but  in  terms  of  distance,  one  degree shrinks  from  sixty-eight  miles  at  the  
Equator  to  virtually  nothing  at the poles.

Precise  knowledge  of  the  hour  in  two  different places  at  on ce—a  long itu de  
prerequisite  so  eas ily accessible  today  from  any  pair of  cheap  wristwatches— was  utterly  
unattainable  up  to  and  including  the  era  of
pendulum  clocks.  On  the  deck  of  a  rolling  ship,  such clocks  would  slow  down,  or  
speed  up,  or  stop  running altogether.  Normal  changes  in temperature  encountered en route 
from a cold country  of origin to a tropical  trade zone  thinned  or  thickened  a  clock’s  
lubricating  oil  and
made  its  metal  parts  expand  or  contract  with  equally disastrous  results.  A rise  or 
fall  in  barometric  pressure, or  the  subtle  variations  in  the  Earth's  gravity  from  one 
latitude  to  another,  could  also  cause  a  clock  to  gain  or lose time.

         For  lack  of  a practical  method  of  determining  lon- gitude,  every  great  
captain  in  the  Age  of  Exploration became  lost  at sea  despite  the  best  available  charts  
and compasses.  Untold  numbers  of  sailors  died  when  their destinations  suddenly  loomed  out 
 of  the  sea  and  took
them  by  surprise.  In  a  single  such  accident  on  October 22,  1707, at the Scilly  Isles 
 near  the southwestern  tip of England,  nearly  two thousand  men lost their lives.

The  quest  for  a  solution  to  the  problem  of  longi- tude  persisted  over  four  centuries  
and  across  the  whole
continent  of   Europe.  The  B ritis h  Parliament,  in  its famed  Longitude  Act of  1 714,  
set the highest  bounty  of all,  naming  a  prize  equal  to  several  million  dollars  in 
today's  currency  for  a  “Practicable  and  Useful”  means ot determining  longitude.
ACT-59F-PRACTICE                                                                                    

          English  clockmaker  John  Harrison,  a  mechanical genius  who  pioneered  the  
science  of  portable  precision timekeeping,  devoted  his  life  to  this  quest.  He  accom- pl 
is hed  wh at  Ne wton  had  fe ared  i mp os si b le:   He invented  a clock  that  would carry  
the true  time from the
home  port,  like  an  eternal  flame,  to  any  remote  corner of  the  world.
With  no formal  education  or apprenticeship to any watchmaker,  Harri son  nevertheless  
constructed  a  series of  virtually  friction-tree clocks  that required  no lubrica-
tion  and  no  cleaning,  that  were  made  from  materials impervious  to rust, and that kept 
their moving  parts per- fectly  balanced  in  relation  to one  another,  regardless  of how  the  
world  pitched  or  tossed  about  them.  He  did away  with  the  pendulum,  and  he  combined  
different
metals  inside  his  works  in  such  a  way  that  when  one component  expanded  or  
contracted  wi th  changes  in temperature,  the other counteracted  the change and kept the clock’ 
s rate constant.
His  every  success,  however,  was  parried  by  mem—
bers  of  the  scientific  elite,  who  distrusted  Harrison’ s magic  box.  The  commissioners 
 charged  with  awarding the  longitude  prize changed  the  contest  rules  whenever they  saw  
fit,  so  as  to favor  the  chances  of  astronomers over  the  likes  of  Harrison  and  his  
fellow  “mechanics.”
But  the utility  and  accuracy  of  Harrison’ s  approach  tri- umphed  in  the  end.  In  
1773  he  claimed  his  righttul reward.  His  followers  shepherded  Harrison’ s  intricate, 
exquisite  invention  through  the  design  modifications that enabled  it  to be mass produced  
and enjoy  wide use.

         To  retrace  this  story  in  an  age  when  a  network  of satellites  can  nail  
down  a  ship's  position  within  a  few feet in just a moment or two—is  to see the globe anew.
