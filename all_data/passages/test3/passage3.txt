As  a jazz  trumpeter  and  a singer,  Louis  Armstrong asserted  a  level  of  individuality  in  
musical  interpreta- tion,  recomposition  and embellishment  far  more  radical than  any  that  
had  preceded  it  in  Western  music.  When taced  with  a  musical  theme,  Armstrong  improvised  an arrangement  that  boldly  rephrased 
 it, dropping  notes  he didn't  want  to  play  and  adding  others.  H is  teatured 
improvisations brought  the role of  the jazz soloist  to the tore. The  immaculate  logic  of  his 
 improvised  melodies,
lull  of  rhythmic  surprises  and  v irtuo sic  turns,  influ- enced  show-tune  writers,  
jazz  composers,  b ig  band arrangers  and tap dancers.  His harmonic  inno vations, as tellow  
trumpeter  Wynton  Marsalis  has  noted,  were  the most  brilliant  in  the  history  of  jazz:  
Armstrong  figured
out how  to articulate  the sound of  the blues  through  Tin Pan  Alle y  popular- music  
tunes  without  abandoning their  harmonic  underp innings.  “Louis  Armstrong  took two   
different   musics   and   fused   them   so  that   they sounded  perfectly compatible,”  Mr.  
Marsalis says.

         It  was during  the  1920’s  and  30’s  that  Armstrong’s reputation  took  off.  He 
set  the  music  scene  in  his  home town   of   New   Orleans   on   t ire   before   traveling   
to Chicago  in  19to  join  his  mentor,  the  cornetist  King Ol iver.  For  a  year  he  went 
 to  New  York,  where  he
joined  Fletcher  Henderson’s  jazz  orchestra  and  turned the  rhythm  ot  the  music  around 
 with  his  conception  of playing  with  a  s winging  beat.  Now  almost  a  national musical  
terror,  Armstrong  returned  to  Chicago,  then finally  settled in  New  York in 1929.

         From  19through  the  early  1930’s,  he  recorded dozen s  ot   masterpieces  
with  large  and  s mall  bands, popularized  scat  singing  (jazz  singing  that  uses  non- sense 
syllables)  and  took  on Tin  Pan  Alley,  introducing one tune after another into jazz,  where 
they  became part
of  his repertory.  His tone could  be broad,  soft and lumi- nous  or  vocal  or  comical,  or 
 suddenl y  and  indelibl y noble,  and  when  his  music  conquered  Europe  in  the 30’s,  it  
carried  the  tragic  opti mis m  of  the  American sensibility  into  the  world  at  large.  
Wherever  he  went,
swing  was  sure  to  follow.  He  almost  single-handedly began  a  new  spirit  of  
freewheeling  but  perfectly  con- trolled  improvisation,  tinged  with  playfulness,  sorrow and 
sardonic  irony.
Like  all  innovators,  Armstrong  was  also  called
upon  to perform  superhuman  feats.  Armstrong  had end- less  energy  and  could  play  and  
play  and  play  with  the evangelical  fire  and  charisma  that  brings a  new  art  into being.  
 He   extended   the   ran ge   of   his   instrument, asserted  unprecedented  rhythmic  fluidity  
and  had  the
greatest  endurance  of  any  trumpet  player  who  ever lived.  As  a  young  man,  he  could  
play  five  shows  in  a theater  a  day,  be  the  featured  soloist  on  virtually  every piece  
and  end  each  show  with  1high  C  notes.  His


glissandos—rapid sli des  up  or  down  a  musical  scale—
were so pronounced  that trumpeters  of  the London  Phil- harm onic   Orchestra   had   to  in 
spect   hi s   horn   to   be convinced  that it was not made differently  from theirs.

By  his  death  in  197 l,  Armstrong  had  influenced the  entirety  of  American  music,  
instrumentally  and
vocally,  inspiring  his  own  generation  and  successive ones. I can recall  some 30 years  
ago talking  with a con- cert  percu ssionist  who  knew  Armstrong  and  the  rest  of the people  
who  were rising  to the top during  the middle and  late  20’s.  Referring  to  a  certain  
concert  piece,
which  had  a  more  extensive  drum  part  than  usual,  he said,   “When   I  get  that  
going,  I  can  put  my  Loui s Armstrong  influence  in  and,  without  them  even  know- ing it, 
the orchestra starts to swing for a bit.” On a more recent  occasion,  unless  I was imagining  it, 
I even  heard
rapper  Heavy  D  slip  a  phrase  over  the  mechanical  hip- hop beat that had an Armstrong  
arch  to it.

To get  right  down  to it,  no one in  jazz  ever  played with  greater  emotional  range  than  
Armstrong,  whose New  Orleans  experiences  meant  that  he  worked  every-
thing  from  christening s  to  funerals.  In  the  streets,  he picked  up all the folk chants 
 and  songs. While  traveling around  town,  he  heard  traces  of  French  and  Italian opera  
that  suffused  his  sensibility  and  his  memory.  But beyond  all  that,  what  Armstrong  
wanted  to give his lis-
teners  was  the  kind  of  pleasure  music  gave  him,  which is  what  most  artists  are  
after.  When  he  wrote  or  talked of  New  Orleans,  of  being out there  with  his horn  or fol- 
lowing  the  parades  or  listening  to  mentors  like  Joe Oliver,  Armstrong  never  failed  to  
project  a  joy  so  pro-
found  that  it  became  an  antidote  to  the  blues  of  daily living.  He  had  a  
determination  to  swallow  experience whole and taste  it all  and only  then  to spit out the 
bitter parts.
