Passage  A by Thad Carhart

Even  when  Luc  was  busy  and  could  not  talk  he always  made  me  welcome  and  allowed  me  
to  wander around  the inner sanctum  of  the back room on  my  own. When  things  were  quieter,  
he  seemed  glad  of  the  company  and  would  tell  me  about  the  pianos  that  had  just arrived.  Our  talks  made  real 
 for  me  one  of  his  funda- mental  beliefs,  that  each  and  every  piano  had  com- pletely  
individual  characteristics,  even  if  of  the  same manufacturer  and age.
         Sometimes  he  knew  all  the  details,  had  even  met the owners and  talked  about  
their  instrument  with  them and  knew  intimately  how  they  had  treated  it.  Other times  he 
knew  nothing  beyond  what  he  could  see,  feel, or  hear.  Most  often  pianos  came  to  him  
from  auctions
and  charity  sales,  their  history  anonymous.  But  even then,  like an expert in artifacts, 
 he could  deduce  a great deal:  whether  a  piano  had  been  played  much  or  little, whether  
it had  been  in  an  environment  with  the  proper level  of  humidity  (one  of  his  cardinal  
rules),  whether
there  had  been  children  in  the  household,  even  whether it  had  recently  been  
transported  by  ship.  (“The  worst thing  you  can  possibly  do to a piano,”  he  told  me  more 
than  once.)  At  these  moments  he  was  part  detective, part archaeologist, part social critic.
         His  attitude  about  how  people  treated  their  pianos seemed  to  mirror  his  
philosophy  of  life.  While  regret- ting  the depredations  worked  by  children  on  keyboards 
and  strings,  he  regarded  them  as  tolerable  because  the piano  was at least  used  and,  as 
he  put it,  “au  sein de  la
famille”  (“at the heart of  the family”).  It was more  than just  any  piece  of  furniture,  
but  it  was  that,  too,  and  if drinks  were  spilled  and  stains  bit  into  shiny  finishes,  
it was  the  price  one  paid  for initiating  the  young  to a  joy that should  stem from 
familiarity  rather than reverence.
         Those  who  preserved  their  piano  as  an  altar  upon which  the  art  of  music  
was  to  be  worshipped  irritated
Luc,  but  he  was  deeply  respectful  of  serious  musicians who  used  and  depended  upon  
their  instrument  for  their livelihood.
Passage B by Arnold Steinhardt

          Marc  Lifschey,  one  of  the  greatest  oboists  of  his era,   told  me   that   
after  retiring   as  a  performer   and teacher,  he  sold his oboe. On  the face of it, giving  
up an instrument  you  no  longer  use  seems  perfectly  reason- able,  but  nevertheless  I  was  
taken  aback.  Marc  was  not
merely  an  excellent  oboist;  he  was  a  great  artist.  Still, Marc  didn't do it alone. He 
 and his oboe did it together. Even  in  retirement,  wouldn't  Marc  have  some  sort  of lasting  
relationship  with  his  oboe  that  transcended  per- forming  on  it?  Wouldn't  he  want  to  
keep  it  if  for  no
other  reason   than  as  a  reminder  of  the  magnificent music  the  two of them had made  
together?
Joseph Roisman,  the distinguished  first  violinist  of the  Budapest  String  Quartet,  seemed  
to  be  content  to give  up his beloved Lorenzo  Storioni  when he agreed  to
sell it  to me after  the Quartet  retired.  But  when I  finally met  with  him,  he  had  
second  thoughts.  “Steinhardt,”  he said  to  me  plaintively,  “I’sell  the  violin  to  you  
some day,  but  for  now  I’m   enjoying  playing  chamber  music with my  friends  every Friday  
night.”  And  that is exactly
what he did until his death a year or two later.
Lifschey  and  Roisman  dealt with retirement  in dif- ferent ways, but their stories made me 
wonder about not only  what  I'll  do  with  my  violin  if  and  when  I  retire, but  also  about 
 the  very  nature  of  a  musician's  day-to-
day,  year-to-year  relationship  with his instrument.
I  began  playing  violin  when  I  was  six  years  old, and  now  I’m   seventy-six.  It has been 
 an integral  part  of my  life  for  the  last  seven  decades.  Does  that  make  the violin  my  
very  close  friend?  Well,  yes.  Sometimes.  The
violin obviously  can't  speak  with  words,  but  when I  ask something  of  it,  the  
instrument  can  respond  with  an astonishing  range  of  substance  and  emotion.  This  is 
friendship  on a most exalted  level.
There   are   other   moments,   however,   when   the
violin  stubbornly  refuses  to  do  my  bidding—when   it only  reluctantly  plays  in  tune,  
or  makes  the  sound  I want,  or delivers  the  music’s  essence  for  which I  strive. Then  I  
have  to  cajole,  bargain  or  adjust  to  its  every





whim.  Some  friend;  more  like  an  adversary,  you  might say.
Or  is  the  violin  my  partner?  A  woman  once  went backstage  to  congratulate  the  great  
violinist  Jascha Heifetz  after  a concert.  “What  a wonderful  sound  your
violin has, Mr. Heifetz!”  she exclaimed.  Heifetz  leaned over his violin that lay in its open 
case, listened intently for  a  moment,  and  said,  “Funny,  I  don't  hear  a  thing.”
My violin also lies mute in its case without me—but, on the  other  hand,  I stand  mute  on  the  
concert  stage  with- out it.
