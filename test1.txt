3333Passage IPROSE FICTION:
This passage is adapted from the title story
of Only the Little Bone,
a collection of short stories by David
Huddle (©1986 by David Huddle).My grandfather has made crutches for me. These
are sturdy crutches, just the right size. I am delighted
with them and launch myself around the house on them.
And take a fall immediately. And continue falling
several times a day, great splatting, knocking-into-fur-
niture-and-breaking-things falls that cause everyone in
the family to come running. My grandfather has for-
gotten to put rubber tips on the ends of my crutches.
When we figure this out and buy the rubber tips and putthem on the crutches, I stop falling. But by then the
bone-set that was coming along nicely has slipped, and
the doctor has ordered me back to the wheelchair.The missing crutch-tips are the first clue I have to
this peculiar family trait, one that for lack of any better
term I must call Òflawed competence.Ó We Bryants are
a family of able and clever people, industrious, intelli-
gent, determined, and of good will. We are careful in
our work. After all, my grandfather measured me on
two occasions before he made the crutches. But we usu-
ally do something wrong.Four years later I become increasingly aware of
Òflawed competenceÓ when I develop a plan for con-
verting our old grown-over tennis court into a basket-
ball court. My grandfather is always interested in plans,
and in this planning session, we decide that he will
make the hoops, and he will help me make the back-
boards. Clearing the ground and smoothing the surface
will be my tasks. So I rip out honeysuckle and hatchet
down a few little scrub cedars. We Bryants are known
for setting our minds to things.Then my grandfather delivers the hoops. They are
beautifully designed and constructed, metalwork of a
high order for such amateurs as my grandfather and his
men. But the hoops are twice as big around as ordinary
basketball hoops.I say, simply, that they are too big. I am not
ungrateful, not trying to be hateful, not in my opinion
being overly fastidious. I am simply describing a char-
acteristic of the hoops. But my grandfatherÕs feelings
are damaged. No, they canÕt be made smaller, and no,
heÕs not interested in helping me with the backboards
now or with any other part of my plan. HeÕs sorry he
got involved in the first place. This, too, is a corollary
of Òflawed competence.Ó We are sensitive, especially
about our work, especially about the flawed part of our
work.At the place where I work twenty-eight years after
the basketball hoops, I am given a new office, one with
a view of the lake. ThereÕs a string attached, though,
and that is that I have to build my own bookcases. I
commence planning with enthusiasm. ThatÕs another,
less harmful family trait, that attraction to making
plans. I measure, I look at other peopleÕs shelves, I get
someone to help me attach brackets to my office walls.It is while I am cutting a notch in one of the
uprights to allow access to the light-switch that I sud-
denly think of my grandfather and those basketball
hoops. I feel a light sweat break out on my forehead. A
pattern of genetic fate reveals itself to me: IÕm going to
mess up these bookshelves just as my grandfather
before me would have messed them up. No doubt IÕm
sawing the notch in the wrong place.The whole time I work I wait to see where the
screw-up is going to come. I imagine what my col-
leagues will be saying about me in the hallways. Did
you know that Bryant built his shelves so they tilt? Did
you know that BryantÕs books rejected the color he
painted his shelves? But the screw-up doesnÕt appear. I
paint the shelves red, and they look O.K. (Granddaddy
Bryant once painted yellow a whole row of company
houses he built.) I paint a chair blue and red, and itÕs 
a little silly-looking, but it picks up the blue of the
carpet and the red of the shelves. The vision isnÕt
nearly as impressive as I thought it would be, but then
what vision ever is? We plan-makers are accustomed 
to things turning out not-quite-as-good-as-we-had-
in-mind. Our world view includes the Òdiminished
excellenceÓ component. Diminished excellence is a
condition of the world and therefore never an occasion
for sorrow, whereas flawed competence comes out of
character and therefore is frequently the reason for the
bowed head, the furrowed brow. Three months later,
when I try to turn the heat off in my office, I discover
that I have placed one of the shelf uprights too close to

was there all along, but in this case I am relieved to
find it. I am my grandfatherÕs grandson after all.1.The passage is written from the point of view of:A.an unidentified narrator observing the relationship
over time between a boy and his grandfather.B.two members of the same family discovering their
shared trait through joint activities.C.a grown man agonizing over the mixed messages
he received as a child from older relatives.D.a boy and the man he becomes considering inci-

scenes that reveal how the discovery came aboutH.Describing the physical details of scenes and sum-
marizing their significance in a concluding state-
ment in the narratorÕs voiceJ.Using dialogue in the midst of scenes fraught with
tension to indicate what the narrator is experi-

reveals:A.the increasing antagonism between the grandfather
and grandson.B.the errors the narrator makes and the disapproval
they bring from others.C.that such incidents set the stage for the Bryant
family traits to emerge.D.that the narrator is determined to avoid being
ungrateful, hateful, or overly fastidious.4.The boyÕs approach to the task of converting the tennis
court to a basketball court can best be described as:F.reluctant until his grandfatherÕs plans inspire him.G.enthusiastic until his grandfatherÕs error puts them
both in an awkward position.H.apprehensive until he discovers his error is not a
devastating one.J.thrilled until he remembers that his grandfather is
a poor planner.5.As he is revealed in the incident of undertaking the
construction of the basketball court, the grandfather
can best be characterized as:A.confidently optimistic, then childishly defensive.B.charmingly patient, then increasingly accusatory.C.consistently encouraging in spite of setbacks.D.vocally defensive, then quietly apologetic.6.The question ÒDid you know that Bryant built his
shelves so they tilt?Ó (lines 65Ð66) helps establish that
the narrator is anxious because:F.his coworkers have discovered his incompetence
and have made it the subject of office humor.G.his coworkers resent his having a corner office and
punish him with their biting humor.H.he fears his incompetence is so glaring it will
make him the object of ridicule among coworkers.J.the tilting bookshelves remind him that, like his
grandfather, he cannot hide his mistakes.7.Information in the second paragraph (lines 4Ð12)
reveals that the familyÕs response to the grandfatherÕs
error with the crutches is to:A.find a workable remedy for it.B.lay the blame on the narrator.C.praise him for more successful projects.D.fix what wasnÕt wrong in the first place.8.It can most reasonably be inferred from the sixth para-
graph (lines 36Ð46) that the statement that the basket-
ball hoops ÒcanÕt be made smallerÓ (line 40) is:F.a fact stated by the grandfather apologetically.G.an opinion stated by the grandfather indignantly.H.a claim the narrator makes to humiliate a relative.J.a conclusion the narrator reaches after hard labor.9.It can most reasonably be inferred that the narratorÕs
discovery that an error has been made in constructing
the bookshelves is for him a source of:A.embarrassment in the face of coworkers who antic-
ipated it.B.comfort because it reveals a trait that he shares
with his family.C.frustration because it will require a remedy that
will be tedious to carry out.D.relief because it gives him an excuse to seek the
assistance of coworkers in finishing the project.10.In the last paragraph, a comparison is made between
Òdiminished excellenceÓ and Òflawed competence.Ó
From the narratorÕs point of view, the conditions are
different because the one is:F.a source of sorrow while the other is a source of
pride.G.based in the family while the other is based in the
self.H.inherent in the environment while the other is
inherent in the individual.J.a sign that the individual can improve the world

3333Passage IISOCIAL SCIENCE:
This passage is adapted from Dava
SobelÕs book Longitude(©1995 by Dava Sobel).To learn oneÕs longitude at sea, one needs to know
what time it is aboard ship and also the time at the
home port or another place of known longitudeÑat that
very same moment. The two clock times enable the
navigator to convert the hour difference into a geo-
graphical separation. Since the Earth takes twenty-four
hours to complete one full revolution of three hundred
sixty degrees, one hour marks one twenty-fourth of a
spin, or fifteen degrees. And so each hourÕs time differ-
ence between the ship and the starting point marks a
progress of fifteen degrees of longitude to the east or
west. Every day at sea, when the navigator resets the
shipÕs clock to local noon when the sun reaches its
highest point in the sky, and then consults the home-
port clock, every hourÕs discrepancy between them
translates into another fifteen degrees of longitude.Those same fifteen degrees of longitude also cor-
respond to a distance traveled. At the Equator, where
the girth of the Earth is greatest, fifteen degrees stretch
fully one thousand miles. North or south of that line,
however, the mileage value of each degree decreases.
One degree of longitude equals four minutes of time 
the world over, but in terms of distance, one degree
shrinks from sixty-eight miles at the Equator to virtu-
ally nothing at the poles.Precise knowledge of the hour in two different
places at onceÑa longitude prerequisite so easily
accessible today from any pair of cheap wristwatchesÑ
was utterly unattainable up to and including the era of
pendulum clocks. On the deck of a rolling ship, such
clocks would slow down, or speed up, or stop running
altogether. Normal changes in temperature encountered
en route from a cold country of origin to a tropical trade
zone thinned or thickened a clockÕs lubricating oil and
made its metal parts expand or contract with equally
disastrous results. A rise or fall in barometric pressure,
or the subtle variations in the EarthÕs gravity from one
latitude to another, could also cause a clock to gain or
lose time.For lack of a practical method of determining lon-
gitude, every great captain in the Age of Exploration
became lost at sea despite the best available charts and
compasses. Untold numbers of sailors died when their
destinations suddenly loomed out of the sea and took
them by surprise. In a single such accident on October
22, 1707, at the Scilly Isles near the southwestern tip of
England, nearly two thousand men lost their lives.The quest for a solution to the problem of longi-
tude persisted over four centuries and across the whole
continent of Europe. The British Parliament, in its
famed Longitude Act of 1714, set the highest bounty of
all, naming a prize equal to several million dollars in
todayÕs currency for a ÒPracticable and UsefulÓ means
of determining longitude.English clockmaker John Harrison, a mechanical
genius who pioneered the science of portable precision
timekeeping, devoted his life to this quest. He accom-
plished what Newton had feared impossible: He
invented a clock that would carry the true time from thehome port, like an eternal flame, to any remote corner
of the world.With no formal education or apprenticeship to any
watchmaker, Harrison nevertheless constructed a series
of virtually friction-free clocks that required no lubrica-
tion and no cleaning, that were made from materials
impervious to rust, and that kept their moving parts per-
fectly balanced in relation to one another, regardless of
how the world pitched or tossed about them. He did
away with the pendulum, and he combined different
metals inside his works in such a way that when one
component expanded or contracted with changes in
temperature, the other counteracted the change and kept
the clockÕs rate constant.His every success, however, was parried by mem-
bers of the scientific elite, who distrusted HarrisonÕs
magic box. The commissioners charged with awarding
the longitude prize changed the contest rules whenever
they saw fit, so as to favor the chances of astronomers
over the likes of Harrison and his fellow Òmechanics.Ó
But the utility and accuracy of HarrisonÕs approach tri-
umphed in the end. In 1773 he claimed his rightful
reward. His followers shepherded HarrisonÕs intricate,
exquisite invention through the design modifications
that enabled it to be mass produced and enjoy wide use.To retrace this story in an age when a network of
satellites can nail down a shipÕs position within a few
feet in just a moment or twoÑis to see the globe anew.11.The function of the first paragraph in relation to the
passage as a whole is to:A.orient the reader to the subject of longitude by
explaining how longitude is determined at sea.B.explain the political significance of developing an
accurate way of determining longitude.C.establish that longitude calculations are necessary
to determine time in two different places at once.D.introduce a discussion of how knowledge of EarthÕs
position relative to the Sun was gained in the
process of advances in timekeeping.33510152025303540455055606570758085

333312.Which of the following best describes the way the fifth
paragraph (lines 48Ð54) functions in the passage as a
whole?F.It puts into historical perspective the difficulty of
solving the longitude problem and introduces the
subject of BritainÕs longitude prize.G.It translates the technical terminology used else-
where in the passage into language that is more
widely understood.H.It sheds light on why it took longer for a solution
to the longitude problem to emerge in Europe than
in other parts of the world.J.It diminishes the importance of the lives that were
lost in the efforts to solve the longitude problem.13.It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that
before HarrisonÕs efforts, other individuals trying to
solve the longitude problem had failed to:A.consider clocks as the potential instrument of cal-
culation.B.agree on why longitude decreases in value at
increasing distances from EarthÕs equator.C.improve upon the features of clocks that made
them unreliable at sea.D.understand the ways that charts and compasses
could be used in connection with timepieces to
calculate longitude.14.The reference to the catastrophe at Scilly (lines 45Ð47)
is used to illustrate the point made in the passage that:F.charts and compasses were poorly made in the
1700s.G.England more than other countries stood to gain
from a solution to the problem of determining lon-
gitude.H.captains were contributing to the problem of lost
lives by resisting a solution to the problem of
determining longitude.J.HarrisonÕs accomplishments addressed shortcom-
ings of navigation whose consequences were vast
in scale.15.Information in the second paragraph (lines 17Ð25)
establishes that one degree of longitude translates into
a distance of:A.sixty-eight miles at EarthÕs equator but less on
either side of EarthÕs equator.B.sixty-eight miles at EarthÕs equator but more on
either side of EarthÕs equator.C.one thousand miles the world over.D.virtually nothing at EarthÕs equator, increasing to a
maximum of sixty-eight miles at the poles.16.Which of the following statements best describes the
metals used in HarrisonÕs clock?F.The metals were identical so that they would
respond consistently to changes in conditions at
sea.G.The metals were different so that their changes in
response to conditions at sea would counteract
each other.H.The metals that remained stable in response to
temperature changes were encased in metals that
were impervious to rust.J.The metals expanded and contracted in ways that
were counteracted by changes in the parts made of
wood.17.The passage suggests that HarrisonÕs principal com-
petitors in the race to develop a means of determining
longitude were:A.the great captains in the Age of Exploration.B.members of the British Parliament.C.trained clockmakers with formal educations.D.individuals in the scientific community.18.According to the passage, there was a delay between
the time when Harrison arrived at a solution to the
problem of longitude and when he received his reward
because his:F.invention predated the Longitude Act of 1714.G.clock was only one of many successful solutions
to emerge simultaneously.H.opponents obstructed his efforts to claim the prize
money.J.supporters abandoned him in order to exploit his
invention for their own financial gain.19.Lines 82Ð84 indicate that others took over HarrisonÕs
work in order to:A.secure a wider range of applications for an instru-
ment that had been used only at sea.B.take credit for his remarkable accomplishments.C.diminish the significance of his clock by having it
mass-produced.D.turn his design into one that could be practically
produced for more users.20.The passage indicates that instruments for determining
longitude now include:F.modified pendulum clocks.G.satellites.H.a network of ships.J.barometers.33

3333Passage IIIHUMANITIES:This passage is adapted from the essay
ÒAlbany, 1958Ó by Lydia Minatoya. It appeared in her book
Talking to High Monks in the Snow
(©1992 by Lydia Minatoya).
This story takes place in Albany, New York.The meter of my childhood was the rising and
plunging of a sewing machine needle: rapid and
smooth, like an endless distant drum roll. My mother
hummed as she sewed. She guided the fabric this way
and that. In 1938, she had graduated from a school of
costume design, and before World War II, she had her
own boutique in Los Angeles. It was a time when the
dream of America never seemed finer.The Albany of my childhood was a festive place,
closer in spirit to the nineteenth century than to the
twenty-first. Italian pushcart grocers crowded southern
city blocks, crafting tiered architectural wonders from
fresh produce and pungent sausage. Heavy-legged
workhorses clopped along cobblestones, delivering
bread from German bakeries and milk from Dutch
dairies. A cable car ran along streets named for trees.Each year in early April, an annual dinner-dance
was sponsored by the pharmaceutical institute where
my father worked as a researcher. A ballroom was
rented in a downtown hotel. Musicians were hired to
play big-band music. The dinner-dance was the only
time when my mother would sew for herself. It was the
one time when my parents went out, alone, together. I
was a romantic child, dreamy and diffuse. For me, the
dinner-dance was an annual event: looked forward to in
long anticipation and back upon with nostalgia.Each year, on a snowy weekday evening, Father
would take us window shopping. The deserted down-
town streets would be a magical glaze of snow-softenedlights and shadowy shop displays. My mother would
linger in front of the mannequins clad in evening
apparel. I would follow along, drunk with wonder.Each year before the tape had desiccated on the
backs of the New YearÕs cards and they had fallen to
the floor, my mother would have decided on the design
for her dinner-dance dress. Then there would be a trip
to the fabric store. I would run my hands along gradu-
ated rainbows of thread spools. I would watch their
changing hues as they shimmered in the light.As the dress took form, my parents would practice
dancing.ÒSlow, slow, quick, quick, slow,Ó Father would
mutter with determination as he trod unmincingly on
Okaa-chanÕs feet and guided her into the walls.ÒNext lady?Ó he gallantly would inquire. My sister
Misa and I would take turns, balancing on the tops of
his shoes, as Father swept us around the room.I always thought that Dinner-Dance Eve had some
of the magic of Christmas. Every year, I would perch
on the bathtubÕs edge. I would watch my father fix his
tie. ÒSee the nice dimple below the knot?Ó Father would
turn from the mirror and bend to show me. ÒThe dimple
is very important.Ó I solemnly would nodÑthe honored
recipient of this arcane cultural wisdom.Back in the bedroom, Okaa-chan would slide into
her new dress. She would glance at her reflection with
modest pleasure. When she moved, I could catch the
sweet scent of face powder.When I was seven or eight, the window shopping
and the dinner-dances stopped. The granite fa“ades of
the downtown stores were grimy with graffiti. Display
windows were boarded with plywood. The elegant
hotels had fallen into disrepair. No one danced to big-
band music anymore.As I grew older, my mother began to sew for
wealthy women. The women lived in country homes
where sunlight, reflected from swimming pools just
beyond French doors, played across fine wood floors.Once after a luncheon in the city, a woman came
to our house for a fitting. Standing erect in the door-
way, then bowing slightly, my mother met her formally.
ÒWonÕt you please come in? May I please take
your coat?ÓÒHere you go. Try to put it somewhere clean.ÓLike an eagle, her words slipped regally down a
great distance and struck with awful ease.After the fitting, my father was ashamed and angry.
ÒActually, I do not like this work,Ó he stormed.
ÒYou do not have to do this; we do not need this kind of
money.Ó He waved his arms dismissively at Okaa-
chanÕs sewing machine. ÒThey come and look at our
home with contempt. You kneel at their hems like a ser-
vant! Mo dame desu yo!It is no good, I tell you!ÓOkaa-chan was intractable. Eloquent in anger, she
blazed over the pronunciation of words that ordinarily
would have left pondering pauses in her speech. ÒI do
not care what they think of me, of our home. They
cannot affect our value.Ó My mother stepped in front of
her sewing machine, as if to shield it from scorn. ÒMy
work gives me happiness.Ó She squarely faced my
father. ÒI do not care if you speak as Husband,Ó she
said. ÒI am a Designer!Ó21.As it is described in the passage, sewing seems most

3333Passage IVNATURAL SCIENCE:
This passage is adapted from the
Preface to neurologist Oliver SacksÕs collection of essays 
AnAnthropologist on Mars(©1995 by Oliver Sacks).NatureÕs imagination, as Freeman Dyson likes to
say, is richer than ours, and he speaks, marvellingly, of
this richness in the physical and biological worlds, the
endless diversity of physical forms and forms of life.
For me, as a physician, natureÕs richness is to be
studied in the phenomena of health and disease, in the
endless forms of individual adaptation by which human
organisms, people, adapt and reconstruct themselves.Defects, disorders, diseases, in this sense, can play
a paradoxical role, by bringing out latent powers,
developments, evolutions, forms of life, that might
never be seen, or even be imaginable, in their absence.
It is the paradox of disease, in this sense, its ÒcreativeÓ
potential, that forms the central theme of this book.Thus while one may be horrified by the ravages of
developmental disorder or disease, one may sometimes
see them as creative tooÑfor if they destroy particular
paths, particular ways of doing things, they may force
the nervous system into making other paths and ways,
force on it an unexpected growth and evolution. This
other side of development or disease is something I see,potentially, in almost every patient; and it is this which
I am especially concerned to describe.Similar considerations were brought up by A. R.
Luria, who studied the long-term survival of patients
who had cerebral tumors or had suffered brain injuries
or strokesÑand the ways, the adaptations, they used to
survive. He also studied deaf and blind children as a
very young man (with his mentor L. S. Vygotsky).
Vygotsky stressed the intactness rather than the deficits
of such children:A handicapped child represents a qualitatively dif-
ferent, unique type of development. . . . If a blind
child or a deaf child achieves the same level of
development as a normal child, then the child with
a defect achieves this 
in another way, by another
course, by other means;
and, for the pedagogue, it
is particularly important to know the uniqueness of
the course along which he must lead the child.
This uniqueness transforms the minus of a hand-
icap into the plus of compensation.That such radical adaptations could occur demanded,
Luria thought, a new view of the brain, a sense of it not
as programmed and static, but rather as dynamic and
active, a supremely efficient adaptive system geared for
evolution and change, ceaselessly adapting to the needs
of the organismÑits need, above all, to construct a
coherent self and world, whatever defects or disorders
of brain function befell it. That the brain is minutely
differentiated is clear: there are hundreds of tiny areas
crucial for every aspect of perception and behavior. The
miracle is how they all cooperate, are integrated
together, in the creation of a self.This sense of the brainÕs remarkable capacity for
the most striking adaptations, not least in the special
(and often desperate) circumstances of neural or sen-
sory mishap, has come to dominate my perception of
my patients and their lives. So much so, indeed, that I
am sometimes moved to wonder whether it may not be
necessary to redefine the very concepts of ÒhealthÓ and
Òdisease,Ó to see these in terms of the ability of the
organism to create a new organization and order, one
that fits its special, altered disposition and needs, rather
than in the terms of a rigidly defined Ònorm.ÓSickness implies a contraction of life, but such
contractions do not have to occur. Nearly all of my
patients, so it seems to me, whatever their problems,
reach out to lifeÑand not only despite their conditions,
but often because of them, and even with their aid.The study of disease, for the physician, demands
the study of identity, the inner worlds that patients,
under the spur of illness, create. But the realities of
patients, the ways in which they and their brains con-
struct their own worlds, cannot be comprehended
wholly from the observation of behavior, from the out-
side.With this in mind, I have taken off my white coat,
deserted, by and large, the hospitals where I have spent
the last twenty-five years, to explore my subjectsÕ lives
as they live in the real world, feeling in part like a natu-
ralist, examining rare forms of life; in part like an
anthropologist, a neuroanthropologist, in the fieldÑbut
most of all like a physician, called here and there to
make house calls, house calls at the far borders of
human experience.31.The quotation by L. S. Vygotsky in lines 32Ð41 is used
in this passage to support the idea that:A.children with handicaps should be studied in the
same way as children defined by physicians as
Ònormal.ÓB.deficits need to demonstrate intactness in order to
be judged acceptable.C.neural or sensory mishap occurs in children as
well as in adults.D.development of children with handicaps may pro-
