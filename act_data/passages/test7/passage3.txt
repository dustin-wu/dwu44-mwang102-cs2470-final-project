Using  photographs  as  educational  resources  pre- sents particular  challenges  and  must  be 
done  with  care. There  is always  more  than  face  value in any  photo,  and historical  photos 
of  American  Indians are no exception.
Photography's  rise  in  the  late  nineteenth  century  coin- cided  with  great  change  in  
American  Indian  communi- ties—an  era  that  capped  over  three  hundred  years  of diseases,  
wars,  cultural  disruption,  and  land  disposses- sion.  As  Indian   people   struggled   to  
adapt   to  catastrophic    changes    to    their    old    ways    of    living, photographers  took  
thousands  of  studio  portraits  and made  what  they  believed  to  be  neutral  ethnographic 
images  of  the  “vanishing  Indian.”  As  Indian  cultures bent   under   pressure   to  
assimilate   into  mainstream
America,  photographers  routinely  captured  images  that compared  the  new  “civilized”  
Indian  to  the  tradition- bound  “savages.”  Indian  delegations  that  traveled  to Washington,  
D.C.,  to  defend  tribal  treaty  rights  were

In  another  well-known  studio  portrait,  circa  1890, Goyathlay  poses with a rifle. To 
late nineteenth century Americans,  Geronimo  was  a  dangerous  enemy,  yet  at the  same  time  a 
 curiosity  and  romantic  symbol  of  the “Wild West.”  This photo personifies  the renegade image 
but, strangely,  it was taken about  two to four years after Goyathlay  surrendered—while  he  was  
a  prisoner  of war.  Why,  then,  was  this  photo  taken?  What  meaning did  it  convey  at  the 
 time?  What  must  have  been  in
Goyathlay's  mind? What does the photo mean today? Is it  loaded  with  historical  truths  or  
is  it  as  empty  as  the prisoner's bullet chamber?
A  few  years  later,  Goyathlay  was  photographed again,  this  time  in  a  more  pastoral  pose 
 and  place
holding  a  melon  in  a garden  with  his  wife  and  three  of their   children.   What   was 
  the   meaning   behind   this photo? Did  people  of  the  time  see  it as a simple family 
photo,  or  did  it  personify   the  government's   policy toward  Indians  at  the  time—subduing 
 feared  and  hated
warriors,  “re educating”  them,  and  teaching  them  to farm  in  order  to  guide  them  
toward  a  “better”  way  of life? Ironically,  the Apaches  had  long farmed  as part of the 
traditional  life they fought so tenaciously  to protect.
The  educational  potential  of  photographs  is  enor-
mous. However,  photographs  are not objective; they can easily  tell as  many  lies as  
truths.  As  much  as any  writ-

photographed  in  studios  and  in  front  of  federal  build-
ings.   Photographers   also   accompanied   government expeditions  to  the  West  where  they 
 documented  tradi- tional  cultures,  leading  the  way  for  tourists  and  com- mercial  
photographers  who  followed,  carrying  their cameras and preconceptions into Native American com-
munities.  These  efforts  generated  a  legacy  of  photo- graphic  images  of  American  
Indian  people  that  can serve  today  as  rich  educational  resources.  But  if  used 
carelessly,  they  can  also  fuel  romanticized  and  stereo- typical perceptions  of American 
Indians.
         Consider   some   of   the   many   photographs   of Goyathlay,   the  Apache   man   
who  Mexicans   named “Geronimo.”  He and other Chiricahua Apaches fought a protracted  war  from  
18to  18against  the  United States for the right to live in their traditional  homelands
rather than on reservations.
The  Chiricahua  Apaches   fight  for  freedom  cap— tured  the  American  imagination  in  the  
late  nineteenth century.  “Geronimo,”  especially,  became  a  legendary figure  and  a  media  
phenomenon   whose  legacy  has
lasted  into  the  twenty-first  century.  He  became  synony- mous  with  courage,  daring,  
and  savage  ruthlessness. World  War  II  paratroopers  shouted  his  name  as  they jumped  from  
airplanes  into  combat.  Movies,  television shows,  comic  books,  popular  songs,  posters,  
T-shirts,
and  American  cities  have  borne  his  image  and  name. One photo that shows Goyathlay  and 
three other Chiric- ahuas  in  their  camp  just  prior  to  surrendering  to  U.S. forces in 1886 
documents  a critical and difficult day for the   people   who  had   fought   so  diligently   for 
  their
freedom.

ten document,  they have to be read  with care in order  to be    understood    accurately    in    
unbiased    and    non- stereotypical  terms. Every  photo of  people contains history,  culture,  and  context.  To  do  justice  to  the  subjects and  their  stories,  it  is 
 crucial  to  fill  in  the  information gaps.  In  addition  to  conducting  background  research, 
try  putting  yourself  inside  these  photos—stand  next  to Goyathlay,  his  peers,  his  wife,  
and  their  children,  and
imagine  their  lives—you  might  begin  to  understand  the world  from  their  points  of  
view.  Framed  with  factual information  and  viewed  empathetically,  each  photo- graph  can  
reach  its  richest  potential  as  a  significant educational  opportunity  and resource.
