"  When  Bradbury  claims,  “Thus  I  fell  into  surprise” (line 46), he's most  nearly   referring  to the:",   discovery  that for him  the secret  to  a creative  out- pouring  was  to  use  a   word-association  method  to write fiction.,   long-forg otten  experiences  he  would  remember when  he  would  talk  with  his  childhood   friends  in person.,   realization  that he wrote more effectively  about his current  experiences  than about his  past.,"   several  methods  other  writers  taught  him  to  help him write honest,  authentic  stories.",A,3
Passage A  indicates  that  Bradbury  believes  all  begin- ning writers  think that they can:,learn  the nature of surprises.,force an idea into creation.,use one word as a catalyst for a story.,become a good  writer through  experiment.,B,3
"  Bradbury’s  claim  “I  would  then  take  arms  against  the word,  or  for  it”  (line  1 2)   most  strongly  suggests  that during his writing sessions,  Bradbury  would:",attempt  to  find  the  one  word  that  ior  him  was  the key to understanding  John Huff.,often  reject  a  word  as  not  being  a  catalyst  for meaningful  writing.,deliberately  choose to write only about a word that inspired  his fears.,feel  as  though  he  were  struggling  to find  a  word's significance  to him.,D,3
"  In  the  seventh  paragraph  of  Passage A  (lines  30-37), B radbur y  explains  his  habit,   over  many  years  as  a writer, of  almost daily:",looking   at  and   writing   about  objects  from  his childhood  that he had saved.,wishing  he  had  kept  more  letters  from  his  child- hood  to trigger his memories.,"   driving  past  his  grandparents'   property,  hoping  to notice  something  that  would   remind  him  of  his past.","     thinking  about  his  grandparents'   property,  hoping to  remember  something  that  would   bring  his  past into locus.",D,3
"  Passage A explains that  when  writing about the charac- ter John  Huff,  Bradbury  had:","   placed  John  in a town  in  Arizona,  where  Bradbury himself  had grown  up.",included  John  in  stories  about  a  town  in  Arizona and in stories about Green Town.,    “moved”  John  to  a  town  other  than  the  town  in which the real-life John Huff  had  grown  up.,   “borrowed”  John  to  use  as  a  minor  character  in many  of  his stories. ACT-1572CPRE                                                                                                                                            37,C,3
"  In  the  first  paragraph  of  Passage B  (lines  52-63),  the narrator describes  John Huff   in a manner  that:","    emphasizes  John's  phys ical  strength  and  intelli- gence, to indicate John's  view of   himself.","   exaggerates  John's  characteristics  and  actions,  to reflect Douglas’s  idolization  of   John.","   highlights  John's  reckless  behavior,  to  show  that Douglas  was most fond of  John's  rebelliousness.","     showcases  John's  talents,  to  make  clear  why  both children  and adults admired John.",B,3
"  Within  Passage B,  the  image  in  lines  74-76  functions figuratively  to suggest  that:","   John's leaving on a stormy  night  was fitting,  given Douglas’s  sadness.",John's disappointment about  moving  was  reflected in his mood all day.,the  mood  of  the  day  changed  dramatically  and irreversibly  once John shared  his news.,   the  sky   in   Green   Town   became   cloudy   at   the moment John told Douglas  he was  moving.,C,3
Both  Passage  A  and  Passage  B  highlight  Bradbury’s use of:,a first person  omniscient  narrator  to  tell a story.,satire and irony  to develop characters.,allegory   to   present   a   complex    philosophical question.,sensory   details   and   imaginative   description   to convey ideas.,D,3
"  Based  on  Bradbury’s  description  in  Passage A  of  his writing  process,  which  of  the  following  methods  hypo- thetically  depicts  a  way  Bradbury  might  have  begun  to write the  story in Passage B?",   Taking  notes  while  interviewing  old  friends  after first deciding  to write a story   about  two boys,"   Forming   two   characters,   determining   that   he would  like  to  tell  a  story  about   loss,  and  then beginning  to write a scene",    Writing   down   the  words   train  ticket   and   then spending  an  hour  writing   whatever  those  words brought  to his mind,   Outlining  the  plot  of  a  story  about  two  boys  that would  end with one boy  leaving on  a train,C,3
"  Elsewhere   in   the   essay   from   which   Passage  A   is adapted,  Bradbury  writes: Was there a real boy named John Huff? There  was.  And  that  was  truly  his  name.  But he didn't  go  away  from  me,  I  went  away   from him. How  do these  statements  apply  to both  the information about  Bradbury’s  approach  as a  storyteller  provided  in Passage A  and  the story  ot  John  Huff  provided  in Pas- sage B?",    They  reveal that Bradbury  believed  that to surprise readers is a fiction  writer's  most  important  task.,   They  reinforce  that  Bradbury  used  his  life  experi- ences  to  create  fiction  but   also  altered  those  expe- riences as he pleased.,   They  prove  that  Bradbury  felt such  pain over leav- ing John that  he had  to reverse   events  to be able  to write the story.,They  indicate  that  Bradbury  rarely  used  his  life experiences  to create fiction.,B,3
The primary  purpose  of  the passage is to:,   provide  an  overview  of  the  mechanics  and  key operations  of’ the jaws ot  trap-jaw   ants.,   analyze  Patek  and  Baio’s  techniques  for  filming two defensive maneuvers  of  trap-jaw   ants.,compare  the  jaws  of  Odontomachus  bauri  to  the jaws of  other species of ants.,describe  the  evolution  of  the  ability  of  trap-jaw ants to perform  an escape  jump.,A,4
  The  sentence  in  lines  73-75  and  the  last  sentence  of the  passage  are  examples  of   the  author's  rhetorical technique of:,weaving  sarcasm  into  a  mostly  casual  and  playful article.,interjecting  a  lighthearted  tone  into  a  primarily technical  article.,   integrating  a  slightly  combative  tone  into  an  arti- cle that mostly  praises  two  scientists'  work.,incorporating  personal  anecdotes  into  an  article that mostly  reports data.,B,4
"  As  it  is  used  in  lines  81-82,  the  phrase  well-defended prey most  nearly  refers  to  prey  that:",have a hard outer shell.,attack  with a lethal bite.,travel and attack in groups.,move quickly.,A,4
  The  passage  makes  clear  that  the  main  source  of  the speed of  the jaws of  the  trap-jaw  ant is the:,ease of  movement of  the hinge of  the jaw.,"    continuous,  steady firing of  the jaw's mandibles.",light weight  of the jaw in relation  to the ant's body weight.,release of energy  stored  by muscles of  the jaw.,D,4
  The  author  uses  the  analogy  of  trying  to  grab  popcorn as it pops in order to describe   the trap-jaw  ants'  ability to:,generate heat with  their  jaw movements.,move to high ground in order to attack  prey.,attack  intruders  by  tossing  them  out of  the nest.,bounce around frantically  when intruders approach.,D,4
"  One  main  purpose  of  the  last  paragraph  is  to  suggest that  unlike  their   bouncer-defense  jump,  the  trap-jaw ants'  escape  jump  may  have arisen  through:",the ants'  trying  and failing to bite intruders.,a  change  in  the  structure  of  the  mandibles  of  sev- eral lineages of  ants.,an accidental  behavior  of  the ants.,the  ants'  experiencing  a  positive  outcome  when they  would  attack  in  a large group.,C,4
"  As  it  is  used  in  line  31,  the  word  domain  most  nearly means:",living space.,area of expertise.,taxonomic  category.,local  jurisdiction.,B,4
  The passage points to which of  the following  as a char- acteristic  of  trap-jaw  ants'   mandibles  that  prevents  the ants  from  harming  themselves   with  their  powerful bite?,A  hinge  prevents  the  mandibles  from  snapping together  forcefully.,Mandibles  with  cushioned  inner  edges  provide  a buffer  when  the mandibles  snap shut.,A  latch  mechanism  prevents  the  mandibles  from closing completely.,The  mandibles   begin   to  decelerate  before  they meet.,D,4
"  As  described  in  the  passage,  one  benefit  of  the  trap- jaw ant’s escape  jump  is that  it allows an ant  to:",land   in   position   to  launch   a   new   attack   on   a predator.,"   confuse a predator  with a quick, sudden  sting.",signal to other ants using a predictable  movement.,point  itself  in  whichever  direction  it  chooses  to escape.,A,4
