It was never Kenney  Holmes's  intention  to become a  wedding  singer.  The  grandson  of  West  
Indian  immi- grants,  Holmes  was raised  in Gordon  Heights,  on Long Island,  in  what  he  
calls  “a  small  black  community
founded  by  like-minded  thinkers,”  families  of  immi- grants   and   Southern   blacks   
who,   as  Holmes   says, “didn't  come  here  to  fool  around”  and  who  handed down   to   
their   children    their   own   keen   sense   of ambition.
         “We  grew  up in  that  kind of  atmosphere,”  he  says, “of  positive  thinking,  of  
getting  educated,  whether  or not you had a degree.”
Like  any  American  boy  in  the  1950s  and  ’60s,  he was  fascinated  with  popular  music:  He 
 listened  to  the
area's one radio station, which “mostly played  Sinatra”; sometimes  in  the  evenings,  with  
a  coat  hanger  stuck into  the  top  of  his  portable  radio,  he  could  pick  up  a faint 
signal from WWRL,  a rhythm  and  blues station  in New  York  City.  When  he  was  a  teenager,  
his  brother
brought  home  a  guitar.  “I  was  16,  it  was  a  Sunday night,” he says. “I sat down  and 
played  ‘I Can't Get No Satisfaction.’ I was addicted.”
While  he  was  not  a  virtuoso,  he  was,  he  discov- ered,  good  at  making  money  at  it.  
He  learned  three
songs—“Satisfaction”  by  the  Rolling  Stones,  “And  I Love  Her”  by  the  Beatles,  and  
“Shotgun”  by  Junior Walker  and  the  All  Stars—and  formed  a  band.  “We went  out  and  sold  
it,”  he  says.  “We  could  play  those three  songs  all night.  We  got  pretty  popular  out  
on  the
island,  playing  battle  of  the  bands,  fire  halls,  high school proms, for $10 a night.”
Still, a career as a musician  was not what he, or his family,  had  had  in  mind.  Over  the  
next  few  years,  he says: “I did everything  I could  not to be a guitar player.
I went to college not to be a guitar player.” Thinking he would  be  a  psychiatrist,  he  took 
 pre-med  classes  but didn't  complete  a degree. Along  the  way,  he  continued playing 
nightclubs and parties.
In  his  mid-20s,  he  visited  his  brother  in Washing-
ton. Washington  looked, to Holmes, like a good place to be  an  ambitious,  career-minded  
black  man,  but  it  also had  a  thriving  music  scene  in  nightclubs  and  hotel lounges,  and 
 the  next  years  played  out  as  a  sort  of tussle  between  his creative  pursuits  and  
his  more  busi-
ness-driven  impulses.  Trying  to work his way  up in the music  scene,  he  played  five  and 
 six  nights  a  week  in nightclubs  and  wrote  his  own  music.  He  started  a recording  
studio  called  Sound  Ideas,  which  trawled local  talent for  the  makings  of  a hit song,  but 
he found

of  a  starving  artist,  when  an  agent  approached  him  in the early ’90s about specializing in 
wedding and private parties,  Holmes decided  to try it.
It  was  a  revelation.  “I  could  make  in  one  night what  I  used  to make  in five,”  he  
says.  And  “it changed the culture of  what I was doing.”
Holmes  was well-suited  for the role of event band- leader.  His  production  skills  helped  
him  control  his band's sound, and his familiarity  with country, big-band and  classical  music  
made  him  popular  with  audiences who wanted,  as he says,  “a tango or a Viennese  waltz,”
as well as Wilson  Pickett.
         Because  business  ebbs  and  flows  with  the  seasons and  the  economy,  Holmes  
has  always  kept  a  variety  of sidelines,  including  a job  driving  a  limousine  for  nine 
years  to  put  his  oldest  daughter  through  a private  high school  and  college.  These  days, 
 at  gigs,  he  hands  out  a
stack  of  million-dollar  “bills”  printed  with  his  image and  his  current  enterprises:   
bandleader,   commercial mortgage  broker,  hard  money  lender.
Holmes  uses  as  many  as  eight  musicians  and  two singers  for  weddings.  He  accepts  
turnover  as  a fact  of
running  a  band,  but  his  current  core  line up  has,  in  the mercurial  world  of  
part-time  performers,  been  fairly steady.  Sam  Brawner,  the  drummer,  and  Atiba  Taylor, the 
sax player, have  played  with  him for three  and four years,   respectively,   and   Bruce   
Robinson,   the  key-
boardist, has played  with him for 15.
This  is  perhaps  partly  because  Holmes  insists  on making  music.  During  performances,  he  
lets  his  musi- cians  take  the lead  and  uses specialized,  stripped-down tracks, called 
digital sequences,  to set the tempo and fill
in  musical  parts  when  necessary,  ultimately  preferring
the  messy  alchemy  of  live  music  to  something  more canned.  The  musicians  say  that  this  
is  in  contrast  to other  bandleaders  they've  worked  for,  who  often  rely heavily on 
recordings and  use musicians  more as visual
props.  Holmes's  respect  for  the  music  endears  him  to his  musicians.  “These  guys  
play  from  the  heart,”  says
Robinson.  “They're  not  just  trying  to  get  through  the gig the pickings slim.
The  club  scene,  after  a  long  while,  began  to  wear on him,  as  well.  Unwilling  to resign 
 himself  to  the  life
