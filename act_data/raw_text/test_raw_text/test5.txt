Passage I

PROSE  FICTION:  This passage  is adapted  from the novel The Ground   Beneath  Her  Feet  by  
Saiman  Rushdie  (01999  by Salman Rushdie).

Art Deco is an architectural  and decorative style that was popu- lar in the first half of the 
twentieth century.

When  you  grow  up, as I did, in a great city, during what  just  happens  to  be  its  golden  
age,  you  think  of  it as  eternal.  Always   was  there,   always   will  be.  The grandeur  of  
the  metropolis  creates  the  illusion  of  per-
5  manence.  The  peninsular  Bombay  into  which  I  was born  certainly  seemed  perennial  to  
me.  Malabar  and Cumballa   hills   were  our   Capitol   and  Palatine,   the Brabourne  Stadium  
was  our  Colosseum,  and  as  for  the glittering  Art  Deco  sweep  of  Marine  Drive,  well,  
that
10   was  something  not  even  Rome  could  boast.  I  actually grew  up believing  Art Deco to be 
the “Bombay  style,”  a local  invention,  its  name  derived,  in  all  probability, from  the 
imperative  of  the  verb  “to see.”  Art  dekho. Lo and  behold  art.  (When  I  began  to  be  
familiar  with
15  images  of  New  York,  I  at  first  felt  a  sort  of  anger.  The Americans  had  so  much;  
did  they  have  to  possess  our “style”  as  well?  But  in  another,  more  secret  part  of  my 
heart,  the  Art  Deco  of  Manhattan,  built  on  a  scale  so much  grander  than  our  own,  
only  increased  America's
20  allure,  made  it  both  familiar  and  awe-inspiring,  our little Bombay  writ large.)

In  reality   that  Bombay   was  almost   brand-new when  I knew  it;  what's  more,  my  parents' 
 construction firm of  Merchant  & Merchant  had  been prominent  in its
25  making. In the ten years before my own coming into the world,  the city  had  been a gigantic  
building  site;  as if  it were  in  a  hurry  to  become,  as  if  it  knew  it  had  to  pro- 
vide  itself  in  finished  condition  by  the  time  I  was  able to start  paying  attention  to  
it  ...     No,  no,  I  don't  really
30  think  along  such  solipsistic  lines. I’m not over-attached to history, or Bombay.  Me, I’m  
the under-attached type.

But  let  me  confess  that,  even  as  a  child,  I  was ins ane ly  jealous  of  the  city  in  
which  I  was  raised, because it was my parents'  other love. They loved each
35  other  (good),  they  loved  me  (very  good),  and  they loved her (not so good). Bombay  was 
my rival. It was on  account  of  their  romance  with  the  city  that  they drew  up  that  
weekly  rota  (list)  of  shared  parental responsibilities. When  my  mother  wasn't  with  me—
40  when I was riding on my father's shoulders, or staring,

                                     32
with  him,  at  the  fish  in  the  Taraporewala  Aquarium— she  was  out  there  with  her,  with  
Bombay;  out  there bringing  her  into  being.  (For  of  course  construction work  never  stops  
completely,  and  supervising  such
45  work  was  Ameer's  particular  genius.  My  mother  the master  builder.  Like  her  father  
before  her.)  And  when my  father  handed  me  over  to  her,  he  went  off,  wearing his  
local-history  hat  and  a  khaki  jacket  full  of  pockets, to dig in  the foundations  of  
building sites for the secrets
50  of  the  city's  past,  or  else  sat  hatless  and  coatless  at  a designing  board and 
dreamed  his lo-and-behold  dreams.

Maps  of  the  early  town  afforded  my  father  great joy,  and  his  collection  of  old  
photographs  of  the  edi- fices  and  ob jets  of  the  vanished  city  was  second  to
55  none.   In   these   faded   images   were   resurrected   the demolished  Fort,  the  
“breakfast  bazaar”  market  outside the Teen Dar vaza or Bazaargate,  and the humble mutton shops  
and  umbrella  hospitals  of  the  poor,  as  well  as the fallen  palaces  of  the  great.  The 
early  city's  relics  filled
60  his  imagination  as  well  as  his  photo  albums.  It  was from  my  father  that  I  learned 
 of  Bombay’s  first  great photographers,  Raja  Deen  Dayal  and  A.  R.  Haseler, whose  
portraits  of  the  city  became  my  first  artistic influences,  if  only  by  showing  me  what  
I  did  not  want
65  to  do.  Dayal  climbed  the  Rajabai  tower  to  create  his sweeping  panoramas  of  the  
birth  of  the  city;  Haseler went  one  better  and  took  to  the  air.  Their  images  were 
awe-inspiring,  unforgettable,  but  they  also  inspired  in me  a  desperate  need  to  get  back 
 down  to  ground  level.
70  From  the  heights  you  see  only  pinnacles.  I  yearned  for the  city  streets,  the  knife 
 grinders,  the  water  carriers, the  pavement  moneylenders,  the  peremptory  soldiers, the 
railway  hordes,  the chess players in the Irani restau- rants,  the  snake-buckled  
schoolchildren,  the  beggars,
75  the  fishermen,  the  moviemakers,  the  dockers,  the  book sewers,  the  loom  operators,  
the  priests.  I  yearned  for life.

When  I  said   this  to  my  father   he  showed   me photos,  still lives  of  storelronts  and  
piers,  and  told  me I
80  was  too  young  to  understand.  “See  where  people  lived and worked and shopped,”  he 
clarified,  with a rare flash of  irritation,  “and  it  becomes  plain  what  they  were like.”  
For  all  his  digging,  Vivvy  Merchant  was  content with  the  surfaces  of  his  world.  I,  
his  photographer  son,
85  set  out  to  prove  him  wrong,  to  show  that  a  camera  can see  beyond  the  surface,  
beyond  the  trappings  of  the actual, and penetrate to its flesh and heart.

Passage II

SOCIAL  SCIENCE:   This  passage   is  adapted   from   Greaf Waters:  An  Atlantic  Passage  by  
Deborah  Cramer  (@2001  by Deborah Cramer).

The Sargasso Sea is a part of the northern Atlantic Ocean.

As  the  Crame r  idles  through  the  S argas so  Sea, waiting  for  the  wind  to  rise,  the  
sea  is  flat  and  empty. Nothing  demarcates  or  divides  the  smooth  expanse  of water  
dissolving  into  the  horizon.  This  vast,  unrough-
5  ened  surface,  this  breadth  of  uniform  sea, deceives.  But for  a  few  lonely  oceanic  
islands,  the  unperturbed  sur- face  offers  no  hint  of  the  grand  and  sweeping  energies 
hidden  below.
Only  one thousand  miles  offshore,  the Cramer  has
10   already   sailed   through   some   of   Atlantic’s   deepest waters.  Contrary  to  what  one 
 might  guess,  Atlantic’s deepest  waters, like those in other oceans,  are along her edges.  As  
we  continue  east,  toward  the  middle  of  the sea, the bottom  rises. The unmarked  plains of  
the abyss,
15  here flattened  by  layers  of  sediment,  give  way  to  rising foothills  and   then  to  
mountains.  The  first  maps  of Atlantic  seafloor  noted,  albeit  crudely,  this  rise.  Early 
efforts  to  plumb  Atlantic’s  depths  proved  outrageously inaccurate:  one  naval  officer  paid 
 out  eight  miles  (thir-
20  teen  kilometers)  of  hemp  rope  from  a drifting  ship  and concluded  the  sea  had  no  
bottom.  Eventually,  sailors more  or  less  successfully  calculated  depth  by  heaving 
overboard  cannonballs  tied  to bailing  twine.  When  they hit  bottom,  the  sailors  measured  
and  snipped  the  twine
25  and  then  moved  on,  leaving  a  trail  of  lead  strung  out across  the seafloor.  These 
crude soundings, forming  the basis  of  the  first  map  of  Atlantic’s  basin,  published  in 
1854,  identified   a  prominent   rise  halfway   between Europe and America.

30           For  many  years  no  one  could  explain   why  the basin  of  Atlantic,  unlike  a  
bowl,  deepened  at  its  edges and  shoaled  in  its  center.  People  assumed   that  this 
“Middle  Ground,”  “Telegraph  Plateau,”  or  “Dolphin Rise,”  as  it  was  variously  called,  was 
 an  ancient  and
35  drowned  land  bridge,  or  a  lost  continent,  but  sailors repairing  trans atlantic  
telegraph  cable  unknowingly produced  evidence  to  prove  otherwise.  Wrestling  with the  
broken  cable,  they  accidentally  twisted  off  a  piece of  the  “plateau”  and  dredged  up  a  
twenty-one-pound
40  (ten-kilogram)  chunk  of  dense  black  volcanic  rock.  It was some of  the youngest,  
freshest rock on earth, and  it was torn  not from a piece of  continent  sunk beneath  the waves,  
but from the very foundation  of  the sea.
Today,  highly  sophisticated  sound  waves  bring  the
45  hazy  images  of  those  early  soundings  into  sharp  focus, revealing  that  one  of  the  
largest  and  most  salient  geo- graphic  features  on  the  planet  lies  on  the  floor  ot  the 
ocean.  Hidden  beneath  the  waves  is  an  immense  sub- merged  mountain  range,  the  backbone  
of  the sea. More
50  extensive,  rugged,  and  imposing  than  the  Andes,  Rock- ies,  or  Himalayas,  it  covers  
almost  as  much  of  earth's surface  as  the  dry  land  of  continents.  Winding  like  the seam 
 of  a  baseball,  it circles  the  planet  in  a  long,  sinu-
ACT-1572CPRE                                                                                        
                                                   34

ous  path, running  the entire length  of  Atlantic,  slashing the  basin  neatly  in  two.  Its  
mountains  are  stark  and black,  as  black  as  the  sea  itself,  lit  only  at  their  peaks by 
a thin, patchy covering of  white, the skeletal remains of  tiny  microscopic  animals  that  once  
lived  at  the  sur- face.  Peaks  as  high  as Mount  St. Helens  sit in  a  watery
60  world of  blackness,  more than  a mile below  the surface, beyond  the reach of  light, beyond 
 the sight of  sailors.

A  great  valley,  eclipsing  any  comparable  feature on  dry  land,  runs  through  these  
mountains.  Arizona's Grand  Canyon,  one  of  earth's  most  spectacular  places,
65  extends  for  about  280 miles  (450 kilometers).  A lesser- known  canyon  of  similar  depth  
but considerably  greater length   lies   hidden   in   the   mountains   of   the   ridge. 
Although  offset  in  many  places  by  breaks  in  the  moun- tains, the rift valley, as the 
canyon  is called, extends  the
70  length  of  Atlantic for 11,000 miles  (17,700 kilometers). Here  in  this  bleak  and  
forbidding   place,  where  the water  is  almost  freezing,  subterranean  fires  have  lifted 
mounds  of  fresh lava  onto  the seafloor.  Scientists  visit- ing  the  rift  valley  for  the  
first  time  named  the  volcanic
75  hills  in  this  otherworldly  setting  after  distant,  lifeless planets.

Yet,  what  had  seemed  so foreign  to scientists  is an integral  part  of  earth's  very  being, 
 for  at  the  ridge  our own  planet  gives  birth.  The  floor  of  the  rift  valley  is
80  torn;  from  the  gashes  has  sprung  the  seafloor  underly- ing all of  Atlantic. Here the 
youngest,  newest pieces are made.  Earth  is  still  cooling  from  her  tumultuous  birth four 
and a half  billion  years ago. Heat, leaking from  the molten  core and from  radioactive  decay  
deep inside the
85  planet, rises toward  earth's  surface,  powering  the volca- noes that deliver the ridge to 
the sea.











11.  The  author's  attitude  toward  the  main  subject  of  the passage can  best be described  
as:
A.   awe and fascination.
B.   disbelief  and cynicism.
C.    amusement  and  nostalgia.
D.   boredom  and indifference.

12.  The  passage  makes  clear  that  “Middle  Ground,”  “Tele- graph  Plateau,”  and  “Dolphin  
Rise”  were  names  that people  gave to what  was actually:
F.    an island  in Atlantic.
G.   a transatlantic  telegraph  cable.
H.   an ancient  and drowned land bridge.
J.     the immense  mountain  range in Atlantic’s  basin.

13.  In  the first paragraph,  the author  describes  the stillness of  the  Sargasso  Sea  as  the 
 Cramer  passes  through  it primarily  to emphasize  that the stillness:
A.   won’t  last  long,  f'or  the  sea  will  become  rough when  the wind rises.
B.    makes  it  easy  for  a  passenger  on  the  Cramer  to spot oceanic islands  that break the 
water's  surface.
C.   is in  dramatic  contrast  to  the  power  of  what  exists on and under  the seafloor far 
below.
D.   makes  it  seem  as  if  the  c'rainer’s  wake  is dividing the unbroken  expanse of  water 
into  two.

14.  The  passage  states  that  compared  to  Arizona’s  Grand Canyon,  the  canyon  that  lies  
within  the  mountains  in Atlantic’s  basin is considerably:
F.    deeper.
G.   older.
H.   wider.
J.     longer.

15.  The  main  purpose  of  the information  in  lines  71—76  is to:
A.   describe  in  detail  scientists'  expectations  for  their first  trip to the rift valley.
B.   characterize  the  rift  valley  as  an  alien,  seemingly barren  place.
C.   provide  statistics  about  several  geographic  proper- ties of  the rift valley.
D.   list  the  names  that  scientists  gave  to  the  volcanic hills in  the rift valley.

16.  One  of  the  main  purposes  of  the  last  paragraph  is  to state that the:
F.    gashes  in  the  rift  valley  continue  to  increase  in width.
G.   seafloor of  Atlantic  has cooled.
H.   entire  Atlantic  seafloor  has issued  from the gashes in the rift valley.
J.     volcanoes  on  Earth's  dry  land  have  created  the newest, youngest  pieces of  Atlantic  
seafloor.

                                                  35

17.   The  author  most  strongly  implies  that  people  com- monly  assume the deepest  waters of 
 an ocean  are:
A.   about one thousand  miles offshore.
B.   at the middle of  the ocean.
C.    dotted  with islands.
D.   located in trenches.




18.  As it is used in line 19, the phrase paid  out most nearly means:
F.    dispensed.
G.   ascertained.
H.   suggested.
J.     compensated.




19.  According   to   the   pass age,   the   mountain   range   in Atlantic’s  basin  covers  
nearly  the  s ame  amount  of Earth's  surface as does:
A.   Mount St. Helens.
B.   the Himalayas.
C.    the Pacific Ocean.
D.   the dry land of  continents.




20.  According  to the passage,  the white cover on the peaks of  the mountains  in  Atlantic’s  
basin  is:
F.    skeletal remains of  microscopic  animals.
G.   thin layers of  sedimentary  volcanic ash.
H.   patches of ice.
J.     salt deposits.

Passage III

HUMANITIES:  Passage  A is adapted from the essay “Just This Side of Byzantium” by Ray Bradbury  
(01975 by Ray Bradbury), which  is  the  introduction  to  a  later  edition  of  Bradbury's  1957 
novel  Dandelion  Wine.  Passage B  is  adapted  from  Dandelion Wine  (Oc1957 by Ray Bradbury).

Passage  A by Ray Bradbury

I began  to learn  the nature  of  surprises,  thankfully, when  I  was  fairly  young  as  a  
writer.  Before  that,  like every  beginner,  I thought  you  could  beat,  pummel,  and thrash  
an  idea  into  existence.  Under  such  treatment,  Of
5  course,  any  decent  idea  folds  up  its  paws,  turns  on  its
back, fixes its eyes on eternity,  and dies.

It  was  with  great  relief,  then,  that  in  my  early twenties I floundered into a 
word-association process  in which  I simply  got  out  of  bed  each  morning,  walked  to
10   my desk, and  put down any  word or series of  words that happened  along in  my head.

I  would  then  take  arms  against  the  word,  or for  it, and  bring  on  an  assortment  of  
characters  to  weigh  the word  and show  me its meaning  in my own  life. An hour
15  or  two  hours  later,  to  my  amazement,   a  new  story would  be finished  and  done. The  
surprise  was  total  and lovely.  I soon found  that I would  have to  work  this  way for the 
rest of  my life.
First  I  rummaged  my  mind  for  words  that  could
20  describe  my  personal  nightmares,  fears  of  night  and time from my childhood,  and shaped  
stories from  these.

Then  I  took  a  long  look  at  the  green  apple  trees and the old house I was born in and the 
house  next door where  lived  my  grandparents,  and  all  the  lawns  of  the
25  summers  I  grew  up  in,  and  I  began  to  try  words  for  all that.

was startled  when  truths leaped  out of  bushes  like quail before  gunshot.  I  blundered  into 
creativity  as  any  child
50  learning  to  walk  and  see. I learned  to let my  senses  and my  Past  tell me all that was 
somehow  true.
Passage B by Ray Bradbury

The facts about John  Huff, aged twelve,  are simple and  soon  stated.  He  could  pathfind  more  
trails  than anyone  since time  began,  could  leap from the sky like a chimpanzee  from  a  vine, 
 could  live  underwater  two minutes  and  slide  iifty  yards  downstream  from  where you  last  
saw  him. The  baseballs  you  pitched  him  he hit in  the  apple  trees,  knocking  down  
harvests.  He  ran laughing.  He sat easy.  He  was  not a bully.  He was kind.
60  He  knew  the  names  of  all  the  wild  flowers  and  when the  moon  would  rise  and  set.  
He  was,  in  fact,  the  only god  living  in  the  whole  of  Green  Town,  Illinois,  during the 
twentieth  century  that  Douglas  Spaulding  knew of.
And  right  now  he  and  Douglas  were  hiking  out
65  beyond  town  on  another  warm  and  marble-round  day, the  sky  blue  blown-glass   reaching 
 high,  the  creeks bright  with  mirror  waters  fanning  over  white  stones.  It was a day as 
perfect  as the flame of a candle.
Douglas  walked  through  it thinking  it would  go on
70  this  way  forever.  The  sound  of  a  good  friend  whistling like  an  oriole,   pegging   
the  softball,   as  you  horse- danced,  key-jingled  the  dusty  paths;  things  were  at hand 
and  would  remain.
It  was  such  a  fine  day  and  then  suddenly  a  cloud
75  crossed  the  sky,  covered  the  sun,  and  did  not  move again.

John  Huff  had  been  speaking  quietly  for  several minutes.  Now  Douglas  stopped  on  the  
path  and  looked over at him.


I had to send  myself  back,  with  words  as catalysts, to  open  the  memories  out  and  see  
what  they  had  to offer.

30           So from the age of  twenty-four  to thirty-six  hardly a day  passed  when  I didn’t  
stroll  myself  across  a recol- lection  of  my  grandparents'   northern  Illinois  grass, hoping 
 to come  across  some  old  half-burnt  firecracker, a rusted  toy, or a fragment  of  letter  
written  to  myself  in
35  some  young  year  hoping  to  contact  the  older  person  I became  to  remind  him  of  his  
past,  his  life,  his  people, his joys, and his drenching sorrows.

Along  the  way  I came  upon  and  collided,  through word-association,  with  old  and  true  
friendships.  I  bor-
40  rowed  my  friend  John  Huff  from  my  childhood  in  Ari- zona  and  shipped  him  East  to  
Green  Town  so  that  I could  say good-bye to him properly.

Along   the   way,   I   sat   me   down   to  breakfasts, lunches,  and  dinners  with  the  long  
dead  and  much
45  loved.

Thus I fell into surprise. I came on the old and best ways  o1 writing  through  ignorance  and  
experiment  and

                                                   36
80           “John, say that again.”
“You heard  me the first  time, Doug.” “Did you say you  were—going  away?”
John  took  a yellow and green  train  ticket  solemnly from his pocket and they  both looked  at 
it.

85           “Tonight!”  said  Douglas.  “My  gosh!  Tonight  we were going  to play  Red Light,  
Green  Light and Statues! How  come,  all  of  a  sudden?  You  been  here  in  Green Town  all my 
life.  You just don't pick  up and leave!”
“It's  my  father,”  said John.  “He's  got  a job in  Mil-
90  waukee.  We weren't  sure until today  ...    ”

They  sat  under  an  old  oak  tree  on  the  side  of  the hill  looking  back  at  town.  Out  
beyond,  in  sunlight,  the town  was  painted  with  heat,  the  windows  all  gaping. Douglas  
wanted  to run  back in  there where the town, by
95  its  very  weight,  its  houses,  their  bulk,  might  enclose and prevent John's ever getting 
up and running off.

Questions  21—25 ask about Passage A.

21.  When  Bradbury  claims,  “Thus  I  fell  into  surprise” (line 46), he's most  nearly  
referring  to the:
A.   discovery  that for him  the secret  to  a creative  out- pouring  was  to  use  a  
word-association  method  to write fiction.
B.   long-forg otten  experiences  he  would  remember when  he  would  talk  with  his  childhood  
friends  in person.
C.   realization  that he wrote more effectively  about his current  experiences  than about his 
past.
D.   several  methods  other  writers  taught  him  to  help him write honest,  authentic  stories.

22.  Passage A  indicates  that  Bradbury  believes  all  begin- ning writers  think that they can:
F.    learn  the nature of surprises.
G.   force an idea into creation.
H.   use one word as a catalyst for a story.
J.     become a good  writer through  experiment.

23.  Bradbury’s  claim  “I  would  then  take  arms  against  the word,  or  for  it”  (line  1 2)  
most  strongly  suggests  that during his writing sessions,  Bradbury  would:
A.   attempt  to  find  the  one  word  that  ior  him  was  the key to understanding  John Huff.
B.   often  reject  a  word  as  not  being  a  catalyst  for meaningful  writing.
C.   deliberately  choose to write only about a word that inspired  his fears.
D.   feel  as  though  he  were  struggling  to find  a  word's significance  to him.

24.  In  the  seventh  paragraph  of  Passage A  (lines  30-37), B radbur y  explains  his  habit,  
over  many  years  as  a writer, of  almost daily:
F.    looking   at  and   writing   about  objects  from  his childhood  that he had saved.
G.   wishing  he  had  kept  more  letters  from  his  child- hood  to trigger his memories.
H.   driving  past  his  grandparents'   property,  hoping  to notice  something  that  would  
remind  him  of  his past.
J.     thinking  about  his  grandparents'   property,  hoping to  remember  something  that  would 
 bring  his  past into locus.

25.  Passage A explains that  when  writing about the charac- ter John  Huff,  Bradbury  had:
A.   placed  John  in a town  in  Arizona,  where  Bradbury himself  had grown  up.
B.   included  John  in  stories  about  a  town  in  Arizona and in stories about Green Town.
C.    “moved”  John  to  a  town  other  than  the  town  in which the real-life John Huff  had 
grown  up.
D.   “borrowed”  John  to  use  as  a  minor  character  in many  of  his stories.
ACT-1572CPRE                                                                                        
                                                   37

Questions 26 and 27 ask about Passage B.

26.  In  the  first  paragraph  of  Passage B  (lines  52-63),  the narrator describes  John Huff  
in a manner  that:
F.    emphasizes  John's  phys ical  strength  and  intelli- gence, to indicate John's  view of  
himself.
G.   exaggerates  John's  characteristics  and  actions,  to reflect Douglas’s  idolization  of  
John.
H.   highlights  John's  reckless  behavior,  to  show  that Douglas  was most fond of  John's 
rebelliousness.
J.     showcases  John's  talents,  to  make  clear  why  both children  and adults admired John.


27.  Within  Passage B,  the  image  in  lines  74-76  functions figuratively  to suggest  that:
A.   John's leaving on a stormy  night  was fitting,  given Douglas’s  sadness.
B.   John's disappointment about  moving  was  reflected in his mood all day.
C.    the  mood  of  the  day  changed  dramatically  and irreversibly  once John shared  his news.
D.   the  sky   in   Green   Town   became   cloudy   at   the moment John told Douglas  he was 
moving.





Questions 28—30 ask about both passages.

28.  Both  Passage  A  and  Passage  B  highlight  Bradbury’s use of:
F.    a first person  omniscient  narrator  to  tell a story.
G.   satire and irony  to develop characters.
H.   allegory   to   present   a   complex    philosophical question.
J.     sensory   details   and   imaginative   description   to convey ideas.


29.  Based  on  Bradbury’s  description  in  Passage A  of  his writing  process,  which  of  the 
following  methods  hypo- thetically  depicts  a  way  Bradbury  might  have  begun  to write the 
story in Passage B?
A.   Taking  notes  while  interviewing  old  friends  after first deciding  to write a story  
about  two boys
B.   Forming   two   characters,   determining   that   he would  like  to  tell  a  story  about  
loss,  and  then beginning  to write a scene
C.    Writing   down   the  words   train  ticket   and   then spending  an  hour  writing  
whatever  those  words brought  to his mind
D.   Outlining  the  plot  of  a  story  about  two  boys  that would  end with one boy  leaving on 
a train

30.  Elsewhere   in   the   essay   from   which   Passage  A   is adapted,  Bradbury  writes:
Was there a real boy named John Huff?
There  was.  And  that  was  truly  his  name.  But he didn't  go  away  from  me,  I  went  away  
from him.
How  do these  statements  apply  to both  the information about  Bradbury’s  approach  as a 
storyteller  provided  in Passage A  and  the story  ot  John  Huff  provided  in Pas- sage B?
F.    They  reveal that Bradbury  believed  that to surprise readers is a fiction  writer's  most 
important  task.
G.   They  reinforce  that  Bradbury  used  his  life  experi- ences  to  create  fiction  but  
also  altered  those  expe- riences as he pleased.
H.   They  prove  that  Bradbury  felt such  pain over leav- ing John that  he had  to reverse  
events  to be able  to write the story.
J.     They  indicate  that  Bradbury  rarely  used  his  life experiences  to create fiction.




31.  The primary  purpose  of  the passage is to:
A.   provide  an  overview  of  the  mechanics  and  key operations  of’ the jaws ot  trap-jaw  
ants.
B.   analyze  Patek  and  Baio’s  techniques  for  filming two defensive maneuvers  of  trap-jaw  
ants.
C.   compare  the  jaws  of  Odontomachus  bauri  to  the jaws of  other species of ants.
D.   describe  the  evolution  of  the  ability  of  trap-jaw ants to perform  an escape  jump.

32.  The  sentence  in  lines  73-75  and  the  last  sentence  of the  passage  are  examples  of  
the  author's  rhetorical technique of:
F.    weaving  sarcasm  into  a  mostly  casual  and  playful article.
G.   interjecting  a  lighthearted  tone  into  a  primarily technical  article.
H.   integrating  a  slightly  combative  tone  into  an  arti- cle that mostly  praises  two 
scientists'  work.
J.     incorporating  personal  anecdotes  into  an  article that mostly  reports data.

33.  As  it  is  used  in  lines  81-82,  the  phrase  well-defended prey most  nearly  refers  to 
prey  that:
A.   have a hard outer shell.
B.   attack  with a lethal bite.
C.   travel and attack in groups.
D.   move quickly.

34.  The  passage  makes  clear  that  the  main  source  of  the speed of  the jaws of  the 
trap-jaw  ant is the:
F.    ease of  movement of  the hinge of  the jaw.
G.    continuous,  steady firing of  the jaw's mandibles.
H.   light weight  of the jaw in relation  to the ant's body weight.
J.     release of energy  stored  by muscles of  the jaw.

35.  The  author  uses  the  analogy  of  trying  to  grab  popcorn as it pops in order to describe 
 the trap-jaw  ants'  ability to:
A.   generate heat with  their  jaw movements.
B.   move to high ground in order to attack  prey.
C.    attack  intruders  by  tossing  them  out of  the nest.
D.   bounce around frantically  when intruders approach.

36.  One  main  purpose  of  the  last  paragraph  is  to  suggest that  unlike  their  
bouncer-defense  jump,  the  trap-jaw ants'  escape  jump  may  have arisen  through:
F.    the ants'  trying  and failing to bite intruders.
G.   a  change  in  the  structure  of  the  mandibles  of  sev- eral lineages of  ants.
H.   an accidental  behavior  of  the ants.
J.     the  ants'  experiencing  a  positive  outcome  when they  would  attack  in  a large group.

37.  As  it  is  used  in  line  31,  the  word  domain  most  nearly means:
A.   living space.
B.   area of expertise.
C.   taxonomic  category.
D.   local  jurisdiction.

38.  The passage points to which of  the following  as a char- acteristic  of  trap-jaw  ants'  
mandibles  that  prevents  the ants  from  harming  themselves   with  their  powerful bite?
F.    A  hinge  prevents  the  mandibles  from  snapping together  forcefully.
G.   Mandibles  with  cushioned  inner  edges  provide  a buffer  when  the mandibles  snap shut.
H.   A  latch  mechanism  prevents  the  mandibles  from closing completely.
J.     The  mandibles   begin   to  decelerate  before  they meet.

39.  As  described  in  the  passage,  one  benefit  of  the  trap- jaw ant’s escape  jump  is that 
it allows an ant  to:
A.   land   in   position   to  launch   a   new   attack   on   a predator.
B.   confuse a predator  with a quick, sudden  sting.
C.   signal to other ants using a predictable  movement.
D.   point  itself  in  whichever  direction  it  chooses  to escape.

40.  When  a  trap-jaw  ant  uses  the  bouncer-defense  jump effectively  on  an  intruder,  which 
 creature(s),  if  any, will  be  propelled  either  out  of  the  nest  or  in  another direction?
F.    The intruder  only
G.   The attacking  ant only
H.   The attacking ant and the intruder
J.     Neither  the attacking  ant  nor  the intruder
