One of  my  best  races could  hardly  be called  a race at  all.  I  was  a senior  in  high  
school,  gunning  to  qualify for  the  USA  Junior  Nationals.  The  previous  summer  I had  
missed  the  cut  by  less  than  a  second  in  the  mile,
and  just  the  day  before,  at  my  high  school  reg ional meet, I had  come  within  
three-tenths  of  a second  in the 500-yard  freestyle.  The  qualification  time  was  4:39.69; I  
swam  a  4:39.95.  The  next  day,  Sunday,  I  drove  with my  mother  to the far side of  Houston 
 where  a time  trial
was   being   held—an   informal,    unad verti sed   event thrown  together  at  the  last  
minute.  The  only  races swum  were  those  the  swimmers  requested  to  swim. Most  were  short, 
 flapping  sprints  in  which  swimmers attempted   to  shave   off   a  few   one-hundredths  of   
a
second.  I  didn't  have  the  courage  to face  the  mile,  and since I'd  struck  out in the 
500 the day  before,  I decided to  swim  the  1,000-yard  freestyle.  Forty  lengths  of  the 
pool. It  was  a race I'd  swum fast enough  to believe  that given   the   right   confluence   of 
  circumstances—cold
water,  an  aggressive  heat,  an  energetic  meet—I  could make the cut. I had fifteen  
seconds  to drop to qualify.

By  the  time  I  stood  up  on  the  blocks,  I  was  not only  the only  one in  the race, I  was 
 practically  the only one in  the natatorium.  The  horn  sounded  and  I  dove  in.
I  was  angry  and  disheartened  at  having  missed  the  cut the day  before  and  I had 
little belief  that  I could  go any faster today.

About  six  hundred  yards  in,  my  coach  started  to pace.  I stayed  steady  on, not  in  a 
hurry,  not about to get
my  hopes  up.  In  my  mind,  I  had  already  missed  the time.  Then  a  boy  from  a  rival 
 high  school,  whom  I hardly  knew,  unfolded  his  legs  and  climbed  down  from the  bleachers 
 and  started  to  cheer.  He  squatted  low  to the  water  and  pointed  his  finger  toward  the 
 end  of  the
pool,  as if  to say, That's  where  you're  going, now  hurry up. I thought,  If he’s 
cheering,  ma ybe I'm  close.

Sometimes  a moment  comes  along  when  the world slows  down,  and  though  everything  else  
moves  around us at the same frenetic  speed,  we're  afforded  the oppor-
tunity  to reflect  in  real-time  rather  than  in  retrospect.  It

is  as  though  we  slip  into  a  worm-hole  in  the  fabric  of time and  space,  travel  into  
the past  and  then  back  again to  the present  in  the same  instant.  That  morning,  swim- 
ming,  I  remembered  a  day  in  late  September  the  year
before,  the  last  day  my  swim  team  had  use  of  an  out- door  pool.  All  summer  long  
my  teammates  and  I swam under  an  open  sky.  After  this  day  we  would  spend  the rest of  
the season in a dank and moldy  indoor  pool.
The  triangular  backstroke  flags  were  strung  across
the  lanes  and  the  adjacent  diving  well.  My  teammates liked  to run  down  the long  
cement  deck,  jump  out over the  diving  well,  and  try  to  grab  hold  of  the  line.  Many of 
 them  could  jump  far  enough  to make  it. I could  not, though  I  tried  every  day.  I  tried 
 that  day,  and  missed.
Since   I  would   not   have  another   shot   until  May,   I decided  to  try  again.  I  
squared  up  and  ran,  my  feet  wet against the pavement,  and just as my foot hit the water's 
edge,  one  of  my  teammates  called  out  “Jump!”  I  bent my  knees  and  pushed  off  hard  and 
 got  my  hand  around
the  flag  line.  I  pulled  the  whole  thing  into  the  water. Autumn  was  coming  and  I  
wondered  if  there  was  a metaphor  in  what  I  had  just  done;  a  fortune  folded inside  a  
cookie:  my  greatest  effort  would  come  when  I was down  to my last opportunity.

         Now  it  was  March  and  I  was  down  to  my  last opportunity,  thinking  about  
that  day  and  hearing  the word “Jump!”  as my eyes followed  the finger of  the boy pointing  me 
 onward.  What  I  understood—not later,  but right then, in the water—was  how little this swim 
added
up to in the world. I had spent  more than  a year training for  this  one  swim,  and  when  
it  was  finished  the  world would  be  no  different  than  before  it  began.  If  no  one else  
cared,  then  the  swim  was  mine  alone.  It  mattered because  it  was  the  task  before  me  
now,  the  thing  I
wanted  now.  Swimming,  I  had  long  understood,  is  a constant  choice  between  the  now  
and  the later:  exhaus- tion  now  for  the  sake  of  fitness  later,  all  those  Friday nights 
spent in the pool in pursuit of an end that seemed always  one  step farther  on. I  was out of  
laters,  this  was
the end, and I made  my  choice.  I cashed  in  the energy  I set aside for climbing  out of  
the pool  and  unfolding  my towel  and  tying  my  shoes.  I've never  sprinted  harder  in my  
life,  not  before  and  not  since.  I  hit  the wall.  I  knew by instinct,  by  the spasm of  my 
 tendons  and the ache in
my  bones,  before  I  ever  turned  toward  the  clock  or heard my coach scream, that I had 
made it.
