woman  who  congratulates him is intended  to point out that:",    the  woman  hears  Heifetz's  violin  differently  than Heifetz does.,   the  woman  isn't  qualified  to  judge  the  quality  of Heifetz's violin.,   Heifetz enjoyed  the woman's humorous comment.,     Heifetz's  violin doesn't make sounds by itself.,D,1

described as:",    artistic and sophisticated.,   driven and optimistic.,   friendly and easygoing.,    generous and dependable.,B,2

expects   his musicians  to travel long distances.",C,2
"  It  can  most  reasonably  be  inferred  from  the  passage that  Holmes's  band  members
