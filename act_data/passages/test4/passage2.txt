OELA  is  an  acronym  based  on  Portuguese  words  rather  than the  English  words  used  in  
this  article.  A  /uth/er  is  a  maker  of stringed musical  instruments.

The  Amazonian  Workshop  School  for  Fabrication ot  Stringed  Instruments  (OELA)  is  a  small  
part  of  a larger  effort  to  create  a  sustainable  harvest  of  the  great Amazon  forest  and 
 to  give  employment  to  the  region's
burgeoning  population.

“Few  people  know  that  the  Amazon  is  one  of  the most  rapidly  urbanizing  regions  ot  the 
world,”  observes Jose  Gabriel  Lopez,  a Ford  Foundation  program  officer in  Brazil.  The  
city  of  Manaus,  for  example,  has  grown
in  the  past  decade  from  850,0to  1.5  million.  “This rural-urban  migration  and  the 
 resultant  urban  shanty- towns  stand  as  living  symbols  of  failed  or  nonexistent rural  
development   policies,”  Lñpez  says.  “In  many places,  small-scale  rural  producers  have  
been  aban-
doned—devoid  of  health  and education  services,  credit, technical   assistance   and  
opportunity.   What  Rubens Gomes,  founder  of  the  workshop  school,  and  his  col- leagues 
have created  in Manaus is hope.”
Gomes  knows  how  to  build  hope.  The  school,  he
notes  proudly,  is  the  first  to  make  stringed  instruments in the Amazon.  And  it is the 
first in  all of  the Americas to  construct  instruments  exclusively  of   lumber  har- vested  
in  an  environmentally  and  socially  sustainable manner certified  by the Forest Stewardship  
Council.

         “Officially,  there  are  million  cubic  meters  of wood   cut   in   the   
Amazon   annually,”   Go mes   s ays. “Twenty  million  of  this  is  wasted—s awdust,  scraps, 
unwanted  wood  left  to  rot.  And  those  are  the  official numbers. The motive of  this school 
is to transform  what
is  lost  into  thing s  of  value.  Many   people  could  do this—but  there  are  no schools  
teaching  carpentry  in  the Amazon.”

OELA  is  meant  to  help  fill  the  void.  To  graduate, each  student  must  make  a  stringed  
instrument.  All  the
guitars  are  made  from  certified  wood.  Gomes  explains that  traditionally,  Brazilian  
rosewood  and  ebony  were used  in  the  construction   of  guitars.  But  because  of intense  
harvesting,  these  trees  are  close  to  extinction. “I’ve  been  working  for  years,  trying  
to  find  Amazon
woods  that are unknown  on the market, that are in plen- tiful   supply   and   that   can   
be   used   in   instrument making,”  Gomes  says.  He  experimented   with  dozens before  he  
found  types  that  have  the  right  strength  and sound. (Like other  master  luthiers,  he can  
tell  by  touch-
ing  the wood  whether  it  will  reverberate  well.)  Once he identified  the  woods  as  
possible  substitutes,  he  sent them  to a laboratory  to be tested  for the right  grain  and 
density.  Today,  Brosimum  rubescens  is  substituted  for rosewood,   Aniba   canellila  for  
ebony,   and   Protium
species  for  Brazilian  mahogany  and  cedar.  These  and

some  other  undervalued  tropical  hardwoods  have found  their  way  into  the  luthiers’  
workshop,  taking  the pressure off  the better-known  woods.
For  the  past  year,  master  luthier  Ratil  Lage  from
the  Fernando  Ortiz  Instrument-Making  School  of  the Cuban  Music  Institute  has  been  
working  with  the  stu- dents. There are hurdles,  he cautions,  a number  of  them technical.  
The  high  humidity  in  Manaus  means  that  the wood   will   crack   in   drier   climates   
unless   properly
treated.  Glue  frequently  doesn’t  hold.  These  problems are slowly  being resolved.

There  is  also  a  major  obstacle  outside  the  work- shop: The  resistance  of  buyers  to  new 
 woods.  Thus far, most  of  the  instruments  have  been  sold  to  environmen-
talists,  some  of  whom  “adopt”  a  student  by  paying  his or  her  tuition;  the  
student's  “project  guitar”  is  then given  to  the donor  as a gift.

There  is  also  the  possibility  of  contract  work  from outside   the   Amazon.   Gomes’s   
hopes   were   raised
recently  when  the  pres ident  of  a  well-known  guitar company    based   in   Nashville,   
Tennessee,    ordered 1 5   guitars   to   be   auctioned   off   for   the   Rainforest Alliance.
Lage cautions  that it will be a long time before any
of  the  students  can  command  a  master  luth i er’s  fee. “There  is a  saying,”  Lage  
says.  “Anyone  can  make  one good guitar;  it  takes  a master  to make one every  time.”

José  Lucio  do  Nascimento  Rabelo,  director  of  the technical  school,  says,  “By  learning  
this  skill,  students
come  to look  at the torest  in  a new  way;  there  are ways other  than  logging  for  
plywood  and  firewood  to earn  a living,  to  better  the  life  of  the  people.”  One  of  the 
woods  being  used  as  a  replacement  for  the  precious rosewood,  he notes,  is typicall y used 
 to make charcoal.

         Such  an  appreciation  for  the  forest,  says  Rabelo, could  have  a  huge  effect  
on  the  survival  of  the  rain torest; some 80 percent  of  the students come trom other parts of 
 the state of  Amazonas,  and  virtually  all of  them return  to  their  home  towns.  “Some,”  he 
adds, “go on  to
become  politicians  who  will  have  a  direct  influence  on the future of  the forest.”
