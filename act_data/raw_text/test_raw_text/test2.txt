Passage I

PROSE FICTION: This passage is adapted from the short story “American  History”  by  Judith  0 
rtiz-Cofer  (Oc 1992  by  Ju dith Ortiz-Cofer).  The  sto ry  appeared  in  the  anthology   Iguana 
Dreams. New Latino Fiction.

There  was  only  one  source  of  beauty  and  light  for me  my  ninth  grade  year.  The  only  
thing  I  had  antici- pated  at  the  start  of  the  semester.  That  was  seeing Eugene.  In  
August,  Eugene  and  his  family  had  moved
5  into  the  only  house  on  the  block  that  had  a  yard  and trees. I could  see his place 
from  my  bedroom  window  in El Building.  In fact, if I sat on the fire escape I was liter- ally  
suspended  above  Eugene’ s  backyard.  It  was  my favorite  spot  to  read  my  library  books  
in  the  summer.
10  Until that August  the house had  been occupied  by an old couple.  Over  the  years  I  had  
become  part  ot   their family,  without  their  knowing  it, of  course.  I had a  view of  their 
 kitchen  and  their  backyard,  and  though  1 could not hear what they  said, I knew  when  they  
were arguing,
15  when  one  of  them  was  sick,  and  many  other  things.  I knew all this by  watching them 
at mealtimes.  I could  see their  kitchen  table,  the sink,  and  the stove.  During  good times, 
 he sat  at  the  table  and  read  his  newspapers  while she  fixed  the  meals.  If  they  
argued,  he  would  leave  and
20  the old  woman  would  sit  and  stare  at  nothing  for a long time.  When  one ot  them  was 
sick,  the other would  come and  get  things  irom  the  kitchen  and  carry  them out  on  a 
tray. The old man  had died in June. The house had stood empty  for  weeks.  I  had  had  to  
resist  the  temptation  to
25  climb  down  into  the  yard  and  water  the  flowers  the  old lady had taken such good care 
of.

By  the  time  Eugene’ s  family  moved  in,  the  yard was  a tangled  mass ot  weeds.  The father 
 had  spent  sev- eral  days  mowing,  and  when  he  finished,  irom  where  I
30  sat,  I didn’ t see  the red, yellow,  and  purple clusters  that meant flowers  to me. I 
didn't see this iamily  sit down  at the kitchen  table  together.  It was  just  the mother,  a  
red- headed   tall  woman  who  wore  a  white  uniform;  the tather  was gone  before  I  got  up  
in  the morning  and  was
35  never  there at dinner  time. I only  saw  him on  weekends when  they  sometimes  sat  on  
lawn-chairs  under  the  oak tree,  each  hidden  behind  a  section  of  the  newspaper; and  
there  was  Eugene.  He  was  tall  and  blond,  and  he wore  glasses.  I  liked  him  right  away 
 because  he  sat  at
40  the   k i tchen   table   and   read   books   for   hours.   That summer,  before  we  had  
even  spoken  one  word  to  each other,  I  kept  him company  on  my fire escape.


ACT-61 C-PRACTICE
Once  school  started  I  looked  for  him  in  all  my classes,  but  P.  S.  1 3  was  a  huge  
place  and  it  took  me
45  days  and  many  discreet  questions  to  discover  Eugene. Atter  much  maneuvering  1  
managed  “to  run  into  him” in  the  hallway  where  his  locker  was—on  the  other  side ot  
the  buil ding  from  mine—and  in  study  hall  at  the library  where  he  first  seemed  to  
notice  me,  but  did  not
50  speak;  and  tinally,  on  the  way  home  after  school  one day  when  I  decided  to  
approach  him  directly,  though my  stomach  was doing somersaults.

I  was  ready  tor  rejection,  snobbery,  the  worst.  But when   I  came   up   to   him   and   
blurted   out:   “You’ re
55  Eugene.  Right?”  he  smiled,  pushed  his  glasses  up  on his  nose,  and  nodded.  I  saw  
then  that  he  was  blushing deeply.  Eugene  liked  me,  but  he  was  shy.  I  did  most  ot the 
 talking  that  day. He  nodded  and  smiled  a lot. In  the weeks  that  tollo wed,  we  w alked  
home  together.  He
60  would  linger  at the corner  of  El Building  for a few  min- utes  then  walk down  to his 
house.

I  did  not  tell  Eugene  that  I  coul d  see  ins ide  his kitchen  from  my  bedroom.  I  felt  
dishonest,  but  I  liked my  secret  sharing  of  his evenings,  especially  now  that  I
65  knew  what  he  was  reading  since  we  chose  our  books together  at the school 1 ibrary.

I  also  knew  my  mother  was  unhappy  in  Paterson, New  Jersey,  but  my  father  had  a  good  
job  at  the  blue- jeans  factory  in  Passaic  and  soon,  he  kept  assuring  us,
70  we  would  be  moving  to  our  own  house  there.  I  had learned  to  li sten  to  my  
parents'  dreams,  which  were spoken  in  Spanish,  as  fairy  tales,  like  the  stories  about 
life in  Puerto  Rico  betore  I  was  born.  I  had  been  to  the island  once  as  a  little  
girl.  We  had  not  been  back  there
75  since  then,  though  my  parents  talked  constantly  about buying  a  house  on  the  beach  
someday,  retiring  on  the island—that  was  a  common  topic  among  the  residents of  El  
Building.  As for  me,  I  was  going  to  go  to college and become a teacher.

80           But  after  meeting  Eugene  1 began  to  think  ot  the present  more  than of  the 
future. What  I wanted  now  was to  enter  that  house  I  had  watched  for  so  many  years.  1 
wanted  to see the other  rooms  where  the old  people  had lived,  and  where  the  boy  spent  
his  time.  Most  of  all, 1
85  wanted  to  sit  at  the  kitchen  table  with  Eugene  like  two adults,  like  the  old  man  
and  his  wite  had  done,  maybe drink some coffee and  talk about books.

the lawn.
D.   the  weeds  that  had  grown  up  in  the  old  couple’ s lawn  had intertwined  with  the 
flowers,  making  the flowers hard to see.

Passage II

SOCIAL  SCIENCE:  This passage  is adapted  from  volume  2 of Blanche  Wiesen  Cook's  biography  
Eleanor  Roosevelt  (Oc 1999 by Blanche Wiesen Cook).

Eleanor  Roosevelt  [ER]  is  the  most  controvers ia1 First  Lady  in  United  States  history.  
Her  journey  to greatness,  her  voyage  out  beyond  the  confines  ot  good wife  and  devoted  
mother,  involved  determination  and
5  amazing  courage.  It also  involved  one of  h istory’ s most unique  partnerships.  Franklin  
Delano  Roosevelt  [FDR] admired   his   wite,   appreciated   her   strengths,   and depended  on 
her integrity.
However,  ER  and  FDR  had  different  priorities,
10  occasionally  competing  goal s,  and  often  disagreed.  In the  White  Hou s e  they  ran  
two  distinct  and  separate courts.

By  1933  [her  first  year  as  First  Lady],  ER  was  an accomplished  woman  who  had  achieved 
 several  of  her
15  lite's goals. With  her partners,  ER  was a businesswoman who  co-owned  the  Val-Kill  crafts 
 factory,  a  political leader   who   edited    and   copublis hed   the   Women’s Democratic  
News,  and  an  educator  who  co-owned  and taught at a New York school for girls.

20           As  First  Lady,  Eleanor  Roosevelt  did  things  that had  never  been  done  
before.  She  upset  race  traditions, championed  a  New  Deal  for  women,  and  on  certain 
issues   actuall y   ran   a   parallel   admini s tration.   On housing  and  the  creation  of  
model  communities,  for
25  example, ER made decisions  and engineered  policy.

At  the  center  of  a  network  of  influential  women who  ran  the  Women's  Committee  ot  the  
Democratic Party  led  by  Molly  Dew son,  ER  worked  closely  with the  women   who  had  
dominated   the  nation's  social
30  reform  struggles  for  decades.  With  FDR’ s  election,  the goals  of  the  great  
progressive  pioneers,  Jane  Addams, Florence  Kelley,  and  Lillian  Wald,  were  at  last  at  
the forefront  of  the  country's  agenda.  ER's  mentors  since 1903,  they  had  battled  on  the 
 margins  of  national  poli-
35  tics  since  the  1880s  for  public  health,  universal  edu- cation,  community  centers,  s 
anitation  programs,  and government   responsibility   for   the   welfare   of    the nation’ s 
poor and  neglected  people.
Now  their  views  were  brought  directly  into  the
40  White  House.  ER  lobbied  for  them  personally  with  her new administrative allies, in 
countless  auditoriums,  as a radio  broadcaster,  and  in  monthly,  weekly,  and,  by 1936, daily 
columns.  Called  “Eleanor  Everywhere,”  she was interested  in everyone.

45           Every  life  was  sacred  and  worthy,  to  be  improved by  education,  employment,  
health  care,  and  affordable housing.  Her  goal  was  simple,  a  life  of  dignity  and decency 
 tor  all.  She  was  uninterested  in  complex  theo- ries,  and  demanded  action  for  
betterment.  She  feared
50  violent  revolution, but  was not afraid ot socialism—and she courted  radicals.



AGT-6jG-PRACTICE
As  fascism  and  communism  triumphed  in  Europe and  Asia,  ER  and  FDR  were  certain  that  
there  was  a middle  way,  what  ER  called  an  American  “revolution
55  without  bloodshed.”  Her  abiding  conviction,  however, was  that  nothing  good  woul d  
happen  to  promote  the people’ s  interest  unless  the  people  themsel ves  orga- nized  to  
demand  government  responses.  A  people's movement  required  active  citizen  participation,  
and
60  ER's  self-appointed  task  was  to  agitate  and  inspire community  action,  encourage  
united  democratic  move- ments for change.

Between  1933  and  1938,  while  the  Depression raged  and  the  New  Deal  unfolded,  ER  worked 
 with  the
65  popular  front.  She  called  for  alliances  of  activists  to fight  poverty  and  racism  at 
 home,  and  to  oppose  isola- tionism internationally.

Active  with  the  women's  peace  movement,  ER spoke  regularly  at  meeting s  of  the  Women’ s 
 Inter-
70  national  League  for  Peace  and  Freedom,  and  the  Con- ference  on  the  Cause  and  Cure  
of  War.  She  departed, however,  from  pacifist  and  isolationist  positions  and encouraged  
military  preparedness,  collective  security, and ever-widening  alliances.

75           Between  1933  and  1938  ER  published  countless articles  and  six  books.  She  
wrote  in  part  for  herself,  to clear  her  mind  and  foc us  her  thoughts.  B ut  she  also 
wrote  to  disagree  with  her  husband.  From  that  time  to this,  no other  First Lady  has 
actually  rushed  for her  pen
80  to  jab  her  husband's  public  decisions.  But  ER  did  so routinely,  including  in  her  
1938  essay  This  Troubled Wc› rld,  which  was  a  point-by-point  rejection  of  FDR’ s major  
international  decisions.
To contemplate  ER's life of  example and  responsi-
85  bility  is  to  forestall  gloom.  She  understood,  above  all, that  politics  is  not  an  
isolated  individualist  adventure. She  sought  alliances,  created  community,  worked  with 
movements  for  justice  and  peace.  Against  great  odds, and  under  terrific  pressure,  she  
refused  to  withdraw
90  from  controversy.  She  brought  her  network  of  agitators and  activists  into  the  White  
House,  and  never  consid- ered   a   political   setback   a   permanent   defeat.   She enjoyed  
the game,  and  weathered  the abuse.








11.  As  she is revealed  in  the passage,  ER  is best  described as:
A.   sociall y controversial  but quietly  cooperative.
B.    politically  courageous  and socially  concerned.
C.    morall y strong and  deeply  traditional.
D.   personally  driven  but calmly  moderate.


GO ON TO THE  NEXT  PAGE.
36





12.  The  author  presents  ER's  accomplishments  as  excep- tional because ER:
F.    brought  politically  unpopular  views  to  the  fore- front of the nation's polities.
G.   was  the  first  public  figure  to  introduce  political roles for women.
H.   was  a  political  pioneer  struggling  alone  for  social reform.
J.     replaced  community  action  with  more  powerful White House networks.

13.  According  to  the  passage,  ER  believed  that  social reform should include all of  the 
following EXCEPT:
A.   promoting  community  action.
B.   developing  universal education.
C.   supporting  affordable  housing.
D.   establishing involved  theories.

14.  Based  on  the  passage,  ER's  approach  to  social  reform can best be characterized  as:
F.    passionate and theoretical.
G.   patient and flexible.
H.   simplistic  and isolationist.
J.     progressive  and determined.

15.  It  can  reasonably  be  inferred  from  the  passage  that  at the  time  ER  began  working  
for  social  reform,  the United States was:
A.   deeply  committed   to  reforms  in  education  and health care.
B.   experiencing  a  time  of  national  prosperity  that contributed  to  ER's  ideals  
concerning  the  public welfare.
C.   concentrating  on affairs at home due to isolationist policies  and the spread of democracy  
overseas.
D.   unsupportive  of  the  idea  that  the  government  was responsible for the welfare of its 
poor and neglected.

16.   According  to  the  last  paragraph,  which  of  the  fol- lowing  statements  would  the  
author  most  likely  make with regard to ER's vision and ideals?
F.    ER  considered  polities  a  game  and  played  only when  she knew she could  win.
G.   ER  worked  with  agitators  and  remained  dedicated to  the  pursuit  of  justice  and  
peace  in  victory  and defeat.
H.   ER  placed  herself  in  the  position  of  president, making  decisions  that  determined  
White  House policy.
J.     ER  saw  herself  as  the  country's  role  model  and personally  responsible for bringing  
about change.











17.   In  terms  of  the  passage  as  a  whole,  one  of  the  main functions  of  the  third  
paragraph  (lines  13-19)  is  to suggest  that:
A.   ER's  successes  in  various  professional  pursuits helped  prepare  her  to  take  action  
in  the  political world.
B.   ER  had  avoided  the  political  spotlight  in  her  per- sonal  pursuits.
C.   ER  had  competing  and conflicting  interests  during her first year as first lady.
D.   while  ER  had  many  personal  accomplishments, little  could  have  prepared  her  for  life 
 as  the  first lady.



18.  According  to the passage,  the primary  principle  under- lying ER's goals was that:
F.    every person deserved a dignified  and decent life.
G.   as  first  lady,  she  could  talk  about  things  that  had never been discussed before.
H.   through  radio  and  columns,  she  could  show  she was interested  in every person.
J.     she must lead a bloodless  American  revolution.



19.  The  passage  states  that  ER  believed  the  relationship between  a people and their 
government  should  be:
A.   begun  and  carried  out  as  if  it  were  an  isolated, individualist  adventure.
B.    formed  and modeled  by the White House.
C.   based  on  organized,  widespread  citizen  participa- tion.
D.   controlled  through  radio  broadcasts  and  formal channels.



20.  In  the  context  of  the  passage,  the  author's  statement that  ER  “enjoyed  the  game,  
and  weathered  the  abuse” (line 93) most nearly  means that ER:
F.    enjoyed  her  individualist   adventure  in  politics even if criticized.
G.   preferred  to  be  a  team  player  rather  than  take  the lead.
H.   embraced  the  political  life  and  accepted  criticism as part of her work.
J.     understood  political games and so did not take pol- itics or criticism  very  seriously.











21.  Which  of  the  following  statements  best  describes  the structure of  this  passage?
A.   It  begins  and  ends  with  a  series  of  assertions  that surround  a  story  used  by  the 
 narrator  to  support and elaborate  on  those assertions.
B.   It  contains  a  highly  detailed  anecdote  that  the  nar- rator uses to show how  the 
claims she makes  in the first paragraph  are wrong.
C.    It  compares  and  contrasts  the  narrator’ s  perspec- tive on an incident  in her life 
with the perspectives ot several  other  people, such  as her parents.
D.   It consists  mainly  of  a story  about a recent event in the narrator’ s life that she feels 
taught her an  inter- esting  but  ultimately  insignificant  lesson.

22.  In   terms   of   mood,   which   of   the   following   best describes lines 9-44?
F.   A steadily increasing feeling of tension
G.   A consistently  high level of tension
H.   A growing feeling of tension that is finally  broken
J.     A feeling  of  tension  frequently  undermined  by  the narrator's use of irony and humor


23.  The narrator develops the third paragraph (lines 19—29) mainly through:
A.   detached  philosophical  musings  on  the  nature  of the object she sees.
B.   a  detailed  description  of  what  she  did  to  try  to keep the object out of her room.

24.  The narrator indicates that one reason she did not wake her sister Amy when “something” came 
into their room was because:
F.    Amy  had  previously  asked  the  narrator  to  stop waking  her up during the night.
G.   the   narrator   knew   she  could   muster   her  own charmed innocence.
H.   Amy  had  already  figured  out  what  the  thing  was before going to sleep.
J.     the narrator  was  afraid  of  alerting  the thing  to  her own presence.


25.  It can reasonably  be inferred  from the passage  that the narrator  regards  her initial 
discovery  of  the truth about the object entering her bedroom as:
A.   deflating,  because  the  object  turned  out  to  be  so ordinary.
B.   disappointing,  because  she  felt  she  should  have solved  the mystery  many years ago.
C.   satisfying,  because  she  could  at  last  ignore  the object and go to sleep.
D.   significant,  because  solving  the  mystery  led  to important insights.

26.  It can most reasonably  be inferred that for the narrator, the  image  of  the  diver  
bursting  through  “the  ocean's sparkling membrane”  (line 52) symbolizes  her:
F.    fear of monsters and of the object in her bedroom.
G.   crossing  of  the  boundary  separating  her  inner  and outer lives.
H.   struggle  to  maintain  the  separation  between  her inner and outer worlds.
J.     bitterness  at  entering  reality  and  leaving  behind her comforting  memories.

27.  As  it  is  used  in  line  87,  the  phrase  “a  show  in  light” most nearly  refers to:
A.   a fictional story the narrator has read.
B.   a movie the narrator saw at a theater.
C.   the work  of reason in linking  a person  to the outer world.
D.   a fantasy created by the mind.

28.  The  narrator  uses  the images  in  lines  3—5  primarily  to depict the interior life's 
tendency  to engage in:
F.   deceptive self-absorption.
G.   vital self-examination.
H.   useful analysis of nature.
J.    fierce debates  with itself.

29.  Which  of  the  following  statements  best  paraphrases lines 5—8?
A.   The imagination  lacks value and should be ignored in favor of paying attention to the actual 
world.
B.   Reason  can  enhance  the  imagination  but  at  the expense of experience in the actual 
world.
C.   Rather   than   become   isolated,   the  imagination should  connect  to  the  actual  world  
at  least  occa- sionally.
D.   Reason,  not  the  imagination,  is  the  best  way  to appreciate and enrich the actual 
world.

30.  By  her  statements  in  lines  77—80,  the  narrator  is  most nearly  asserting that:
F.   in her  world, adults  are generally  considered  more important than children.
G.   she, like everyone and everything  else, was a small part of a larger world.
H.   it  still  mattered  greatly  whether  people  saw  or ignored her.
J.     she  was  less  valuable  than  other  people  in  her world.

Passage IV

NATURAL  SCIENCE:  This  passage  is  adapted  from  “Publish and Punish:  Science's  Snowball  
Effect”  by Jon  Van (Oc1997  by The Chicago Tribune Company).

It's  a  scientific  finding  so fundamental  that  it  cer- tainly  will  make  the  history  
books  and  maybe  snag  a Nobel  Prize  if  it  pans  out,  but  the  notion  that  cosmic sno 
wballs  are  constantly  pelting  Earth  is  something
5  Louis  Frank  just as soon  would  have ducked.

Frank  is  the  University  ot  Iowa  physicist  whose research  led  him to declare  more than  a 
decade  ago that Earth  is  being  bombarded  by  hundreds  of  house-sized comets  day  after  day 
 that  rain  water  on  our  planet  and
10  are  the  reason  we  have  oceans.  That  weather  report caused  the  widely  respected  
scientist  to  acquire  a  cer- tain  reputation  among  his  colleagues  as  a  bit  unstable, an  
other wise  estimable  fellow  whose  hard  work  may have pushed  him  over the edge.

15           Frank  and  his  associate,  John  Sigwarth,  probably went  a  way  toward  salvag 
ing  their  rep utations  when they  presented  new  evidence  that  leaves  little  doubt Earth  
is  indeed  being  bombarded  by  .s ome thin g  in  a manner  consi stent  with  Frank’ s  s 
mall-comet  theory.
20  Rather   than   gloating   or   anticipating   glory,   Frank seemed  relieved  that  part  ot  
a  long  ordeal  was  ending. “I  knew  we’ d  be  in  for  it  when  we  first  put  forth  the 
small-comet  theory,”  Frank  conceded,  “but  I  was  naive about  just  how  bad  it  would  be.  
We  were  outvoted  by
25  about  10,000  to 1  by  our colleagues.  I  thought  it  would have been more like 1,000 to  I 
.”

To  the  non-scientist  this  may  seem  a  bit  strange. After all, the point of  science is to 
discover  information and  insights  about  how  nature  works.  Shouldn't  every
30  scientist  be eager  to overturn  existing  ideas  and  replace them  with  his  or  her  own?  
In  theory,  that  is  the  case, but in practice,  scientists  are almost  as loath  to embrace 
radically  new ideas as the rest of  us.
“Being  a scientist  puts  you  into  a  constant  schizo-
35  phrenic  existence,”  contends  Richard  Zare, chairman  of the  National  Science  Board.  
“You  have  to  believe  and yet question  beliefs  at  the same  time. II  you  are a com- plete 
cynic  and  believe  nothing,  you  do nothing  and  get nowhere,  but  il  you  believe  too  
much,  you  fool  your-
40  self.”

It  was  in  the  early  1 980s  when  the  small -comet theory  started  to  haunt  Frank  and  
Sig warth,  who  was Frank’ s  graduate  student  study ing  charged  particles called  plasmas,  
which  erupt  from the sun  and cause  the
45  aurora  boreali s  (northern   lights).  As   they  analyzed photos  of  the  electrical  
phenomena  that  accompany sunspots,  they  noted  dark  specks  appearing  in  several images  
from  NASA’ s  Dynamics  Explorer  1  satellite. They  assumed  these  were  caused  by  static  in 
 the  trans-
50  mission.

After  a  while  their  curiosity  about  the  dark  spots grew  into  a  preoccupation, then  
bordered  on  obsession.


ACT-61 C-PRACTICE
Try  as  they  did,  the  scientists  couldn’t  tind  any  plausi- ble   explanation   of   the   
pattern   of   dark   spot s   that
55  appeared  on  their  images.  The  notion  that  the  equip- ment  was  picking  up  small  
amounts  of  water  entering Earth's  upper  atmosphere  kept  presenting  itselt  as  the most 
likely  ans wer.
Based  on  their  image s,  the  Iowa  scientis ts  esti-
60  mated  20  comets  an  hour—each  about  30  feet  or  so across  and  carrying  100  tons  of  
water—were  bombard- ing  the  Earth.  At  that  rate,  they  would  produce  water vapor  that  
would  add  about  an  inch  of  water  to  the planet  every  10,000  years,  Frank  concluded.  
That  may
65  not  seem  like  much,  but  when  talking  about  a  planet billions of  years old, it adds 
up.

Such  intimate  interaction  between  Earth  and  space sugges ts  a  fundamentally  different  
picture  of  human evolution—which  depends   on   water—than   is  com-
70  monly  presented  by  scientists.  Frank  had  great  diffi- culty  getting  his  ideas  into  
a  physics  journal  11  years ago and  was almost  hooted from  the room  when  he pre- sented  
his  theory  at  scientific  meetings.  Despite  the derision,  colleagues  continued  to respect  
Frank’ s main-
75  stream  work  on  electrically  charged  particles  in  space and  the  imaging  cameras  he  
designed  that  were  taken aboard  recent  NASA  spacecraft  to explore Earth's  polar regions.
Unbekno w n   to   mo st,   in   addition   to   gathering
80  information  on  the  northern  lights,  Frank  and  Sigwarth desi gned   the  equipment  to  
be  able  to  snatch  better views of  any  small  comets  the spacecraft  might  happen upon.  It  
was  those  images  from  the  latest  flights  that caused  even  harsh  critics  of  the  
small-comet  theory  to
85  concede  that  some  water-bearing  objects  appear  to  be entering  Earth's  atmosphere  with 
 regularity.

To  be  sure,  it  has  not  been  proved  that  they  are comets,  let alone  that  they  have 
anything  to do with  the oceans.  B ut  Frank’ s  evidence  opens  the  matter  up  to
90  study.  Had  he  been  a  researcher  of  lesser  standing,  his theory  probably  would  have 
died long ago.







31.  Which  of  the foil owing  conclusions  about new theories in science can reasonably  be drawn 
from  the passage?
A.   Important  new  theories  will eventually  be accepted, no  matter  how  controversial  they  
are  or  who  pro- poses them.
B.   Important  but  unusual  new  theories  have  a  better chance  at  acceptance  when  they  
are  proposed  by well-respected scientists.
C.   Research  on  new,  nontraditional theories is widely respected  within  the scientific 
community.
D.   Scientists  welcome  the  opportunity  to  overturn existing  ideas in favor of  useful  new  
theories.

32.  Which  of  the  following  best  describes  how  Frank’ s colleagues  perceived  him  after  
he  first  presented  the small-comet  theory?
F.    Their  doubts  about  the  theory  led  them  to  also question  his work on particles in 
space.
G.   They  felt his  theory  had  ruined  his  reputation  as a widely  respected  scientist.
H.   He  acquired  a reputation  among  them  as  someone who had worked hard to develop his 
theory.
J.     They still respected  his traditional  research  but felt he was overly committed  to an 
improbable  theory.

33.  The   passage   indicates   that   at  the  time  Frank   and Sigwarth presented  new evidence 
supporting  the small- comet theory, Frank most nearly felt:
A.   relieved  but bitter about how he had been treated.
B.    grateful  that ridicule of his work would end.
C.   proud that he had been  proved right.
D.   satisfied and filled with anticipation of glory.

34.  The author  uses the fourth  paragraph  (lines 27-33) pri- marily  to:
F.    continue  his earlier criticisms of scientists.
G.   reveal the role science serves in society.
H.   present  then  undermine  common  perceptions  of scientists.
J.     explain   the  difference  between  theoretical   and practical scientific research.

35.  According  to  the  passage,  the  research  that  led  to  the development  of  the  
small-comet  theory  began  with  a project originally  intended  to study:
A.   the electrical  activity accompanying  sunspots.
B.    water entering Earth's upper atmosphere.
C.   static in satellite transmissions.
D.   specks in satellite images.

36.  The  main  function  of  lines  64-66  in  terms  of  the eighth  paragraph  (lines 59—66)  as 
a whole is to:
F.    give a sense of  proportion  to the numbers  provided earlier in the paragraph.
G.   point  out  the  limitations  of  the  evidence  provided by the Iowa scientists.
H.   supplement   the  paragraph’s   description   of   the comets  with  additional  details  
about  their  size and capacity.
J.     provide readers  with  a sense of  how  old the  planet really is.

37.  It  can  reasonably  be  inferred  from  the  passage  that within  the  scientific  community 
 the  year  the  passage was published,  the small-comet  theory  was:
A.   tremendously   unpopular  and  condemned  for  its incompleteness.
B.    widely  accepted  and seen as conclusive.
C.   regarded  as  tentative  but  deemed  worthy  of  con- sideration.
D.   seen  as  correct  by  most  scientists  but  was  highly criticized  by some.


38.  The  author  italicizes  the  word  something  in  line  18 most likely  to emphasize  the:
F.    great  skepticism  with  which  critics  regard  Frank and Sigwarth's new evidence.
G.   remaining  uncertainty  about  what  exactly  is  bom- barding Earth.
H.   lack  of  doubt  among  scientists  about  the  small- comet theory's  practical value.
J.     concern  among  scientists  about  the  usefulness  of Frank  and  Sigwarth's  methods  of  
collecting  evi- dence.


39.  When  Richard  Zare  says  that  scientists  lead  a  “con- stant  schizophrenic  existence”  
(lines  34-35),  he  most nearly  means  that they:
A.   often  suffer  psychologically  from  the  demands  of their work.
B.    tend  to  be  either  complete  cynics  or  people  who believe too much.
C.   are often  guilty  of  either  doing  nothing  or of  fool- ing themselves.
D.   have  to  maintain  a  balance  between  accepting  and challenging  ideas.


40.  It  can  reasonably  be  inferred  that  Frank  and  Sigwarth conducted  the study of  the 
dark specks they found  with a:
F.    detached, scientific  mindset.
G.   casual interest that developed  into a mild curiosity.
H.   steadily increasing  level of involvement.
J.     great  intensity  that  began  when  they  discovered the specks.
