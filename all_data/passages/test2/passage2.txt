Eleanor  Roosevelt  [ER]  is  the  most  controvers ia1 First  Lady  in  United  States  history.  
Her  journey  to greatness,  her  voyage  out  beyond  the  confines  ot  good wife  and  devoted  
mother,  involved  determination  and
amazing  courage.  It also  involved  one of  h istory’ s most unique  partnerships.  Franklin  
Delano  Roosevelt  [FDR] admired   his   wite,   appreciated   her   strengths,   and depended  on 
her integrity.
However,  ER  and  FDR  had  different  priorities,
occasionally  competing  goal s,  and  often  disagreed.  In the  White  Hou s e  they  ran  
two  distinct  and  separate courts.

By  19[her  first  year  as  First  Lady],  ER  was  an accomplished  woman  who  had  achieved 
 several  of  her
lite's goals. With  her partners,  ER  was a businesswoman who  co-owned  the  Val-Kill  crafts 
 factory,  a  political leader   who   edited    and   copublis hed   the   Women’s Democratic  
News,  and  an  educator  who  co-owned  and taught at a New York school for girls.

         As  First  Lady,  Eleanor  Roosevelt  did  things  that had  never  been  done  
before.  She  upset  race  traditions, championed  a  New  Deal  for  women,  and  on  certain 
issues   actuall y   ran   a   parallel   admini s tration.   On housing  and  the  creation  of  
model  communities,  for
example, ER made decisions  and engineered  policy.

At  the  center  of  a  network  of  influential  women who  ran  the  Women's  Committee  ot  the  
Democratic Party  led  by  Molly  Dew son,  ER  worked  closely  with the  women   who  had  
dominated   the  nation's  social
reform  struggles  for  decades.  With  FDR’ s  election,  the goals  of  the  great  
progressive  pioneers,  Jane  Addams, Florence  Kelley,  and  Lillian  Wald,  were  at  last  at  
the forefront  of  the  country's  agenda.  ER's  mentors  since 1903,  they  had  battled  on  the 
 margins  of  national  poli-
tics  since  the  1880s  for  public  health,  universal  edu- cation,  community  centers,  s 
anitation  programs,  and government   responsibility   for   the   welfare   of    the nation’ s 
poor and  neglected  people.
Now  their  views  were  brought  directly  into  the
White  House.  ER  lobbied  for  them  personally  with  her new administrative allies, in 
countless  auditoriums,  as a radio  broadcaster,  and  in  monthly,  weekly,  and,  by 1936, daily 
columns.  Called  “Eleanor  Everywhere,”  she was interested  in everyone.

         Every  life  was  sacred  and  worthy,  to  be  improved by  education,  employment,  
health  care,  and  affordable housing.  Her  goal  was  simple,  a  life  of  dignity  and decency 
 tor  all.  She  was  uninterested  in  complex  theo- ries,  and  demanded  action  for  
betterment.  She  feared
violent  revolution, but  was not afraid ot socialism—and she courted  radicals.

As  fascism  and  communism  triumphed  in  Europe and  Asia,  ER  and  FDR  were  certain  that  
there  was  a middle  way,  what  ER  called  an  American  “revolution
without  bloodshed.”  Her  abiding  conviction,  however, was  that  nothing  good  woul d  
happen  to  promote  the people’ s  interest  unless  the  people  themsel ves  orga- nized  to  
demand  government  responses.  A  people's movement  required  active  citizen  participation,  
and
ER's  self-appointed  task  was  to  agitate  and  inspire community  action,  encourage  
united  democratic  move- ments for change.

Between  1930 and  1938,  while  the  Depression raged  and  the  New  Deal  unfolded,  ER  worked 
 with  the
popular  front.  She  called  for  alliances  of  activists  to fight  poverty  and  racism  at 
 home,  and  to  oppose  isola- tionism internationally.

Active  with  the  women's  peace  movement,  ER spoke  regularly  at  meeting s  of  the  Women’ s 
 Inter-
national  League  for  Peace  and  Freedom,  and  the  Conference  on  the  Cause  and  Cure  
of  War.  She  departed, however,  from  pacifist  and  isolationist  positions  and encouraged  
military  preparedness,  collective  security, and ever-widening  alliances.

         Between  19and  19ER  published  countless articles  and  six  books.  She  
wrote  in  part  for  herself,  to clear  her  mind  and  foc us  her  thoughts.  B ut  she  also 
wrote  to  disagree  with  her  husband.  From  that  time  to this,  no other  First Lady  has 
actually  rushed  for her  pen
to  jab  her  husband's  public  decisions.  But  ER  did  so routinely,  including  in  her  
19essay  This  Troubled Wc› rld,  which  was  a  point-by-point  rejection  of  FDR’ s major  
international  decisions.
To contemplate  ER's life of  example and  responsibility  is  to  forestall  gloom.  She  understood,  above  all, that  politics  is  not  an  
isolated  individualist  adventure. She  sought  alliances,  created  community,  worked  with 
movements  for  justice  and  peace.  Against  great  odds, and  under  terrific  pressure,  she  
refused  to  withdraw
from  controversy.  She  brought  her  network  of  agitators and  activists  into  the  White  
House,  and  never  consid- ered   a   political   setback   a   permanent   defeat.   She enjoyed  
the game,  and  weathered  the abuse.
