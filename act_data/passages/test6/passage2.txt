Passage  A by Erika Janik

In   early   September   of   1929,   Nikolai   Vav ilov, famed  Russian  plant  explorer  and  
botanist,  arrived  in the  central  Asian  crossroads  of  Alma-Ata,  Kazakhstan. Climbing  up  
the  Zailijskei  Alatau  slopes  of  the  Tian
Shan  mountains  separating  Kazakhstan  from  China, Vavilov  found  thickets  of  wild  apples 
 stretching  in every  direction,  an  extensive  forest  of  fruit  coloured russet  red,  creamy  
yellow,  and  vibrant  pink.  Nowhere else  in  the  world  do  apples  grow  thickly  as  a  
forest  or
with  such incredible  diversity.  Amazed  by  what he saw, Vavilov  wrote:  ‘I could see with 
my own eyes that I had stumbled  upon  the centre of origin for the apple.’

With   extraordinary   prescience   and   few   facts, Vavilov  suggested  that  the  wild  apples  
he  had  seen
growing  in  the  Tian  Shan  were  in  fact  the  ancestors  of the  modern  apple.  He  
tracked  the  whole  process  of domestication  to  the  mountains  near  Alma-Ata,  where the  
wild  apples  looked  awfully  similar  to  the  apples found  at  the  local  grocery.  
Unfortunately,  Vav ilov’s
theory  would  remain  mostly  unknown for decades.

Exactly  where  the  apple  came from  had  long  been a  matter  of  contention  and  discussion  
among  people who  study  plant  origins.  Vavilov,  imprisoned  by  Joseph Stalin  in  19for  
work  in  plant  genetics  that  chal-
lenged  Stalin's  beliefs,  died  in  a  Leningrad  prison  in 1943.  Only  after  the  fall  
of  communism  in  Russia  did Vavilov's  theory,  made more than  half  a century  earlier, become 
 widely  recognized.
As  Vavilov  predicted,  it's  now  believed  that  all  of
the  apples  known  today  are  direct  descendents  of  the wild  apples  that  evolved  in  
Kazakhstan.  Apples  do  not comprise  all of  Kazakhstan's  plant  bounty,  however.  At least  
1other  plant  species  found  in  Kazakhstan  are either   direct   precursors   or   close   
wild   relatives   of
domesticated  crops,  including  per  cent  of  all  culti- vated   temperate   fruits.   
The   name   of   Kazakhstan's largest  city,  Alma-Ata,  or  Almaty  as  it  is  known  today, 
even  translates  as  ‘Father  of  Apples’  or,  according  to some,  ‘where  the  apples  are’.  
So  this  news  about  the
apple's  origins  was  probably  no  surprise  to  residents, particularly  in  towns  where  
apple  seedlings  are  known to  grow  up  through  the  cracks  in  the  pavements.  The apple  
has been  evolving  in Central  Asia for  upwards  of
4.5 million  years.
Passage  B by Gary Nabhan

         Nikolai  Vavilov  is  widely  regarded  as  the  world's greatest  plant  explorer,  
for he  made  over  250,0seed, fruit,  and  tuber  collections  on  five  continents.  Kazakh 
conservationist  Tatiana  Salova  credits  him  with  first recognizing  that  Kazakhstan  was  the 
 center  of  origin

and  diversity  for  apples.  “It is  not  surprising,”  she con- cedes,  “that  when  Vavilov  
first  came  to  Kazakhstan  to look  at  plants  he  was  so  amazed.  Nowhere  else  in  the 
world  do  apples  grow  as  a  forest.  That  is  one  reason why  he stated  that this is  
probably  where  the apple  was
born, this was its birthing  grounds.”

Discerning  where  a  crop  originated  and  where  the greatest  portion  of  its  genetic  
diversity  remains  extant may  seem  esoteric  to  the  uninitiated.  But  knowing where  exactly  
our  food  comes  from—geographically,
culturally,  and genetically—is of  paramount  importance to the rather small  portion of our 
own  species  that regu- larly concerns  itself  with the issue of  food security. The variety  of  
foods  that  we  keep  in  our  fields,  orchards, and,  secondarily,  in  our  seed  banks  is  
critically  impor-
tant  in  protecting  our  food  supply  from  plagues,  crop diseases,  catastrophic  weather, 
 and  political  upheavals. Vavilov  himself  was personally  motivated  to become  an agricultural 
  scientist   by  witnessing   several  famines during  the czarist era of  Russia.  He hoped  that 
by com-
bining  a  more  diverse  seed  portfolio  with  knowledge from  both  traditional  farmers  
and  collaborating  scien- tists,  the  number  of  Russian  families  suffering  from hunger  
might  be reduced.
In  a  very  real  sense,  the  forests  of  wild  foragers
and  the  orchards  of  traditional  farmers  in  such  centers of  crop  diversity  are  the  
wellsprings  of  diversity  that plant  breeders,  pathologists,  and  entomologists  return to  
every  time  our  society  whittles  the  resilience  in  our fields and orchards down to its 
breaking  point.

         And  whittle  away  we  have  done.  Here  in  North America,  according   to  apple  
historian   Dan  Bussey, some  16,0apple  varieties  have  been  named  and  nur- tured over 
the last four centuries.  By 1904, however,  the identities  and  sources  ot  only  7,0of  
those  varieties
could  be  discerned  by  US DA  scientist  W.  H.  Rag an. Since then, some 6,121 apple  
varieties—86. 2 percent  of Ragan's  19inventory—have  been  lost  from  nursery catalogs,  
farmers'   markets,  and  from  the  American table.
