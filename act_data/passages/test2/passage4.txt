It's  a  scientific  finding  so fundamental  that  it  certainly  will  make  the  history  
books  and  maybe  snag  a Nobel  Prize  if  it  pans  out,  but  the  notion  that  cosmic sno 
wballs  are  constantly  pelting  Earth  is  something
5  Louis  Frank  just as soon  would  have ducked.

Frank  is  the  University  ot  Iowa  physicist  whose research  led  him to declare  more than  a 
decade  ago that Earth  is  being  bombarded  by  hundreds  of  house-sized comets  day  after  day 
 that  rain  water  on  our  planet  and
are  the  reason  we  have  oceans.  That  weather  report caused  the  widely  respected  
scientist  to  acquire  a  cer- tain  reputation  among  his  colleagues  as  a  bit  unstable, an  
other wise  estimable  fellow  whose  hard  work  may have pushed  him  over the edge.

         Frank  and  his  associate,  John  Sigwarth,  probably went  a  way  toward  salvag 
ing  their  rep utations  when they  presented  new  evidence  that  leaves  little  doubt Earth  
is  indeed  being  bombarded  by  .s ome thin g  in  a manner  consi stent  with  Frank’ s  s 
mall-comet  theory.
Rather   than   gloating   or   anticipating   glory,   Frank seemed  relieved  that  part  ot  
a  long  ordeal  was  ending. “I  knew  we’ d  be  in  for  it  when  we  first  put  forth  the 
small-comet  theory,”  Frank  conceded,  “but  I  was  naive about  just  how  bad  it  would  be.  
We  were  outvoted  by
about  100 to 1  by  our colleagues.  I  thought  it  would have been more like 1,000 to  I 
.”

To  the  non-scientist  this  may  seem  a  bit  strange. After all, the point of  science is to 
discover  information and  insights  about  how  nature  works.  Shouldn't  every
scientist  be eager  to overturn  existing  ideas  and  replace them  with  his  or  her  own?  
In  theory,  that  is  the  case, but in practice,  scientists  are almost  as loath  to embrace 
radically  new ideas as the rest of  us.
“Being  a scientist  puts  you  into  a  constant  schizo-
phrenic  existence,”  contends  Richard  Zare, chairman  of the  National  Science  Board.  
“You  have  to  believe  and yet question  beliefs  at  the same  time. II  you  are a com- plete 
cynic  and  believe  nothing,  you  do nothing  and  get nowhere,  but  il  you  believe  too  
much,  you  fool  your-
self.”

It  was  in  the  early  1 980s  when  the  small -comet theory  started  to  haunt  Frank  and  
Sig warth,  who  was Frank’ s  graduate  student  study ing  charged  particles called  plasmas,  
which  erupt  from the sun  and cause  the
aurora  boreali s  (northern   lights).  As   they  analyzed photos  of  the  electrical  
phenomena  that  accompany sunspots,  they  noted  dark  specks  appearing  in  several images  
from  NASA’ s  Dynamics  Explorer  1  satellite. They  assumed  these  were  caused  by  static  in 
 the  trans-
mission.

After  a  while  their  curiosity  about  the  dark  spots grew  into  a  preoccupation, then  
bordered  on  obsession.

Try  as  they  did,  the  scientists  couldn’t  tind  any  plausi- ble   explanation   of   the   
pattern   of   dark   spot s   that
appeared  on  their  images.  The  notion  that  the  equip- ment  was  picking  up  small  
amounts  of  water  entering Earth's  upper  atmosphere  kept  presenting  itselt  as  the most 
likely  ans wer.
Based  on  their  image s,  the  Iowa  scientis ts  esti-
mated  comets  an  hour—each  about  feet  or  so across  and  carrying  1tons  of  
water—were  bombard- ing  the  Earth.  At  that  rate,  they  would  produce  water vapor  that  
would  add  about  an  inch  of  water  to  the planet  every  10,0years,  Frank  concluded.  
That  may
not  seem  like  much,  but  when  talking  about  a  planet billions of  years old, it adds 
up.

Such  intimate  interaction  between  Earth  and  space sugges ts  a  fundamentally  different  
picture  of  human evolution—which  depends   on   water—than   is  com-
monly  presented  by  scientists.  Frank  had  great  diffi- culty  getting  his  ideas  into  
a  physics  journal  years ago and  was almost  hooted from  the room  when  he pre- sented  
his  theory  at  scientific  meetings.  Despite  the derision,  colleagues  continued  to respect  
Frank’ s main-
stream  work  on  electrically  charged  particles  in  space and  the  imaging  cameras  he  
designed  that  were  taken aboard  recent  NASA  spacecraft  to explore Earth's  polar regions.
Unbekno w n   to   mo st,   in   addition   to   gathering
information  on  the  northern  lights,  Frank  and  Sigwarth desi gned   the  equipment  to  
be  able  to  snatch  better views of  any  small  comets  the spacecraft  might  happen upon.  It  
was  those  images  from  the  latest  flights  that caused  even  harsh  critics  of  the  
small-comet  theory  to
concede  that  some  water-bearing  objects  appear  to  be entering  Earth's  atmosphere  with 
 regularity.

To  be  sure,  it  has  not  been  proved  that  they  are comets,  let alone  that  they  have 
anything  to do with  the oceans.  B ut  Frank’ s  evidence  opens  the  matter  up  to
study.  Had  he  been  a  researcher  of  lesser  standing,  his theory  probably  would  have 
died long ago.
