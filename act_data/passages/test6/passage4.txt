Astronomers  sometimes  describe  the  shape  of  our home  galaxy,  the  Milky  Way,  as a  
thin-crust  pizza  with a  plum  stuck  in  the  middle.  The  plum  is  the  slightly oblong  
central  bulge,  protruding  about  3,0light-
years  above  and  below  the  galactic  plane,  comprised mostly  of  older  stars; it makes  
up  the core of  the Milky Way,  and  includes  a  black  hole  two  and  a  half  million times  
the  mass  of  the Sun.  The  crust  of  the  pizza  is the galactic  disk—the  source  of  most  
of  our  galaxy's  light.
Thin  and  flat,  the  disk  is  100,0light-years  across, about  1,0light-years  
thick,  on  average,  and  includes more  than  80 percent  of  the galaxy's  hundred  billion  or 
so stars.
The  plum-and-pizza  picture  works  well  enough,
but  like  most  simple  metaphors,  it  breaks  down  if  you push  it.  For  one  thing,  the 
 galactic  disk  isn’t  a  rigid body,  but  a  loose  agglomeration  of  matter  streaming around  
a  common  center  of  gravity.  (The  swirling  pat- tern  of  a  hurricane  far  better  
resembles  our  spinning
galaxy.)  For  another  thing,  our  galaxy's  disk  isn't  flat; it's  warped.  Picture  a 
disk  of  pizza  dough  spun into the air  by  a  skilled  chef:  our galaxy  goes  through  the 
same kind  of  floppy,  wobbly  gyrations,  though  at  a rate  best measured  in  revolutions  per 
 hundreds  of  millions  of
years.

Why   does   the  Milky   Way   have   such   an   odd- looking  warp?  No  definitive  answer  has 
 emerged.  One thing  we  do  know:  when  it comes  to  warps,  our  galaxy is  hardly  unique.  
About  half  of  all  spiral  galaxies  are
warped  to  some  degree.  Theoretical  and  computational models have shown  that a number  of 
 physical  processes can warp a galaxy,  so it's a matter of  figuring  out which scenario  
applies.  An  innovative  analysis  of  the problem by  Jeremy  Bailin,  an  astronomy  graduate  
student  at  the
University  of  Arizona  in Tucson,  has implicated  a small satellite  galaxy,  currently  
being  ripped  to  shreds  by  the gravity  of  the Milky Way.

The Sagittarius  Dwarf  Spheroidal  Galaxy  was  dis— covered  in  1994.  It  appears  to  be  in  
a  roughly  polar
orbit  around  the  Milky  Way—that  is,  above  and  below the  galactic  disk—about  50,0
light-years  from  the galactic  center.  That  orbit  brings  the  dwarf  galaxy  far too  close  
to  the  huge  gravitational  tidal  forces  of  the Milky  Way  for  the  dwarf  to  remain  
intact.  As  a  result,
the Sagittarius  Dwarf  now  looks  something  like  strands of  spaghetti  spilling  from  the 
 front  of  a  pasta-making machine,  the galaxy's  matter  being  drawn out over hun- dreds of  
millions of  years by intergalactic  tides.
Grav itational  coll is ions  between  small  satellite
galaxies   and   big   spiral   galaxies   have   long   been regarded  as  possible  culprits  
in  the  warping  of  a larger galaxy's  disk.  The  best  known  satellite  galaxies  orbit- ing  
the  Milky  Way—the  Large  and  Small  Magellanic Clouds—are  too  far  away,  and  have  the  
wrong  orbital

characteristics,  to  have  warped  our  galactic  home.  The Sagittarius  Dwarf  seems  a much 
 more  likely  candidate, simply  because  it  is  only  a  third  as  far  from  the  center of  
the  Milky  Way  as  the  Magellanic  Clouds.  But  in astronomy—unlike  in  real  estate—location  
isn’t  every-
thing;  to  show  a  direct  connection  between  warp  and dwarf,  the orbital motion  of  the 
Sagittarius  Dwarf  must be linked  to the rotation of  the Milky  Way's disk.

Bailin's  study  is  the  first  to  find  such  a  link.  His analysis   of   the  galactic   warp 
  is   based   on   angular
momentum—a  measure  of  how  much  a  system  is  spin- ning  or  rotating.  Just  as  objects 
 moving  in  a  straight line  have   momentum,   objects   spinning   or  orbiting around  an  
axis have angular  momentum;  and  just  as  the momenta  of  two objects  combine  when  they  
collide,  so
too  do  their  angular   momenta.   Imagine   two  figure skaters  coming  together  for  a  
combination  spin.  When they  make  physical  contact,  their  individual  spiraling motions 
combine  to produce a single, unified  whirl.
Starting  with  the latest  measurements  of  the struc-
ture  and  spin  of  the  Milky  Way,  Bailin  deduced  the angular  momentum  of  the  warped  
portion  ot  the  Milky Way's  disk.  He  then  compared  that  measure  with  the angular   
momentum   of   the   Sagittarius   Dwarf—and found for the first  time,  within  the margins  of  
measure-
ment  error,  that  the  two  angular  momenta  are  identical in  both  quantity  and  
direction.  Such  a  coupling  of  the angular  momenta  of  two  bodies  almost  never  happens by 
 chance;  usually,  it  takes  place  only  when  two  spin- ning  systems,  like  the  skaters,  
come  into  contact.  The
coupling  isn’t  enough  to  prove  cause  and  effect  by itself,  but  it's  solid  
circumstantial  evidence  that  the interaction  of  the Sagittarius  Dwarf  with the Milky Way 
disk created  the warp in our galaxy.
