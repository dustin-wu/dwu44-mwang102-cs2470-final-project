The   woman   never   dreams   and   this   makes   her intensely  mi serable.  She  thinks  that  
by  not  dreaming she  is  unaware  ot  things  about  herself   that  dreams would  surely  give  
her.  She  doesn't  have  the  door  of
dreams  that  opens  every  night  to  question  the  certain- ties  ot  the day.  She  stays  
at  the  threshold,  and  the  door is always closed, refusing  her entrance. I tell her  dial in 
itself  is  a  dream,  a  nightmare:  to  be  in  front  of  a  door which  will not open  no 
matter  how  much  we push  at the
latch  or pound  the knocker.  But in  truth,  the door  to that nightmare  doesn't  have  a  
latch  or  a  knocker;  it  is  total surface,  brown,  high  and  smooth  as  a  wall.  Our  blows 
strike a body  without  an echo.
“There's  no  such  thing  as  a  door  without  a  key,”
she  tel1s  me,  with  the  stubborn  res i stance  ot  one  who does not dream.

“There  are  in  dreams,”  I  tell  her.  In  dreams,  doors don't open, rivers run dry, mountains  
turn  around  in circles, telephones  are made of stone. Elevators  stop in the
middle  ot  II oors,  and  when  we  go  to  the  movies  all  the seats  have  their  backs  
to  the  screen.  Objects  lose  their functionality  in dreams  in  order to become obstacles,  or 
they  have  their  own  laws  that  we  don't  know  anything about.

         She  thinks  that  the  woman  who  does  not  dream  is the  enemy  of  the  waking  
woman  because  she  robs  her of  parts  of  herself,  takes  away  the  wild  excitement  ot 
revelation  when  we  think  we  have  discovered  some- thing   that   we   didn't   know   before 
  or   that   we   had
forgotten.

“A  dream  is a  piece of  writing,”  she says  sadly,  “a work  that  I don't  know  how  to write 
 and that makes  me different  from  others,  all the human  beings  and  animals who dream.”

         She is like a  tired  traveler  who stops  at the thresh- old and  stay s there,  
stationary  as a plant.

In  order  to console  her,  I  tell  her  that  perhaps  she is  too  tired  to  cross  through  
the  doorway;  maybe  she

spends  so  much  time  look ing  for  her  dream s  betore
falling  asleep that she doesn’t  see the image s  when  they appear  because  her exhaustion  
has  made her cl ose those eyes that are inside of  her eyes. When  we sleep we have two  pairs  of 
 eyes:  the  more  superticial  eyes,  which  are accustomed  to seeing  only  the appearance  of  
things  and
of   dealing   with   I ight,  and  dream ’s  eyes;  when   the former  close,  the latter open 
 up. She is the traveler  on a I ong  trip  who  stops  at  the  thres hold,  half  dead  with 
fatigue,  and can no longer  pass over  to the other  side or cross  the  river  or  the  border  
because  she  has  closed
both  pairs of eyes.
“I wish I could open  them,” she says simply. Sometimes  she asks  me  to tell her  my  dreams,  
and
I  know  that  later,  in  the  privacy  of  her  room  with  the light  out,  hiding,  she’ll  try 
 to  dream  my  dream.  But  to
dream  someone  else's  dream  is  harder  than  writing someone  else’s  story,  and  her 
failures  fill  her  with  irri- tation.  She  thinks  I  have  a  power  that  she  doesn't  have 
and  this brings out  her envy  and  bad  humor.  She  thinks that  the world  of  dreams  is an 
extra  life that  some of  us
have,  and  her curiosity  is only  halfway  satisfied  when  I am  finished  telling  her  the 
 last  one.  (To  tell  dreams  is one of  the most difficult arts; perhaps only author Franz Kafka 
 was  able  to do so  without  spoiling  their  mystery, trivializing  their symbols  or making  
them rational.›

         Just  as  children  can't  stand  any  slight  change  and love repetition, she 
insists  that I tell her the same dream two  or  three  times,  a  tale  full  of  people  I  don't 
 know, strange  forms,  unreal  happenings  on  the  road,  and  she becomes  annoyed  if  in  the  
second  vers ion  there  are
some elements  that  were  not in the first.

The  one  she  likes  best  is  the  amniotic  dream,  the dream  of  water.  I  am  walking  under 
 a  straight  line  that is  above  my  head,  and  everything  underneath  is  clear water  that  
doesn't  make  me  wet  or  have  any  weight;
you  don't see it or feel it,  but  you  know  it is there. I am walking  on  a  ground  of  
damp  sand,  wearing  a  white shirt  and  dark  pants,  and  fish  are  swimming  all  around me.  
I eat and  drink  under  the  water  but  I never  swim  or float  because  the  water  is  just  
like  air,  and  I  breathe  it
naturally.  The  line  above  my  head  is  the  limit  that  I never  cross,  nor  do I  have  
any  interest  in  going  beyond it.

She,  in  turn,  would  like  to dream  of flying, ot slip- ping from  tree to tree  way  above the 
rooftops.
