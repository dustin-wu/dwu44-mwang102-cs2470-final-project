I  have  been  an  academic  philosopher  for  the  past
years.  I  came  from  an  academically   disinclined background  in  the  northeast  of  
England,  my  relatives being  mainly  coalminers  and  other  manual  workers.  I
was  the  first  in  my  family  to  attend  university,  and indeed  had no thought  of  it 
until  age 17, when  a teacher mentioned  it  at  school.  My  father  had  become  a  suc- cessful 
 builder, so we were not materially  deprived, and it  was  expected  that I would  become  some  
sort of  tech-
nical  worker.  The  idea  that  I  might  one  day  become  a profes sional  philosopher  was  
inconceivable  in  those days,  to  me  and  everyone  else.  I  was  simply  not  living in  a  
place  where  that  kind  of  thing  ever  happened;  it was  far  likelier—though  still  not  at  
all  likely—that  I
would  become  a  pop  star  (I  played  drums  in  a  rock band).

The  paperback  British  edition  of  my  memoir  The Makin g of  a  Philosc›yher  has  a 
photograph  on  the cover of  a man sitting on a bench,  placed in a grey and listless
landscape.  He  is  overlooking  the  sea  on  a  misty  grim day,  and  the  atmosphere  is  
bleak  and  melancholy.  The man,  hunched  up,  immobile,  coiled  almost,  has  a  pen- sive  
posture,  as  if  frozen  in  thought.  This  picture  is based  on  a  story  I  tell  in  the  
book  about  sitting  on  a
bench  in  Blackpool,  aged  18,  pondering  the  metaphysi- cal question  of  how  objects  
relate to their  properties.  Is an  object  just  the  sum  total  of  its  properties,  a  mere 
coalescence  of  general  features,  or does  it  somehow  lie behind  its  properties,  supporting 
 them,  a  solid  peg  on
which  they  happen  to  hang?  When  I  look  at  an  object do  I  really  see  the  object  
itself,  or  just  the  appearance its  properties  offer  to  me?  I  remember  the  feeling  of 
fixation  that  came  over  me  when  I  thought  about  these questions—a   kind   of   floating   
fascination,   a   still
perplexity.

When I look  back on this period in my late teens, I recall  the  harnessing  of  undirected  
mental  energy  by intellectual  pursuits.  Up  until  then,  my  mental  energy had  gone  into  
things  like reading  Melod y Maker, which
contained  fairly  serious  articles  about  pop  musicians;  I always  knew  the  top  off 
 by  heart,  and  studied  the articles  about  drummers  intensely,  hoping  to  improve my  own  
technique.  I suspect  that  this  kind  of  swashing mental  energy  is fairly  typical  of  boys  
that  age. School
doesn't  seem  to  connect  with  it,  and  it  goes  off   in search  of  some  object  of  
interest,  often  trivial,  some- times  destructive.  In  my  case,  it  was  philosophy  that 
seized  that  energy  and  converted  it  into  a  passion— though  one  that  took  several  years 
 to form  fully.  It  is  a

I  was  ten,  and  for  butterflies  and  lizards  before  that.
How   to  harness   such  passions   to  formal  education remains  a great and unresolved  
problem.

It  was—of  course—a  teacher  who  tapped  into  my formless  and  fizzing  mental  energy.  Mr  
Marsh,  teacher of  divinity,  brimmingly  Christian,  a  man  with  very
active  eyebrows  and  sharp  enunciation,  in  love  with scholarship  (oh,  how  he  relished 
 that  word)—it  was  he who first  brought  out my  inner  philosopher.  From him I heard  of  
Descartes,  locked  up  in  his  room,  wondering whether  anything  could  really  be  known  
beyond  his
own  existence.  But  what  I mainly  got from  the enthusi- astic  Mr  Marsh  was  the  desire 
 to  study.  His  own  pas- sion  for  study  shone  through,  and  he  managed  to  make it  seem, 
 if  not  glamorous,  then  at  least  exhilarating— when  done  the  right  way  and  in  the 
right  spirit.  Pencils
and  stationery  were  made  to  seem  like  shiny  tools,  and the  pleasure  of  making  
one's  mark  on  a  blank  sheet  of paper  hy mned.  Choosing  a  good  spot  to  study   was 
emphas ised.   Above   all,   I   learned   a   very   valuable lesson,  one  that  had  hitherto  
escaped  me:  make  notes.
Thinking  and  writing  should  be  indissoluble  activities, the  hand  ministering  to the 
thought,  the  thought  shaped by  the  hand.  Today,  if  I  find  myself  without  pen  and paper 
 and  thoughts  start  to  arrive,  my  fingers  begin  to twitch  and  I  long  tor  those  
implements  of  cog itation.
With   such   rudimentary   tools   you   can   perform   the miracle  of  turning  an  
invisible  thought  into  a  concrete mark,  bringing   the  ethereal  interior  into  the  public 
external  world,  refining  it  into  something  precious  and permanent.  The  physical  pleasure  
of  writing,  which  I
find  survives  in  the  use  of  a  computer,  is  something worth dwelling  on in matters  of 
education.
