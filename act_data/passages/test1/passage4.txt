Nature's  imagination,  as  Freeman  Dyson  likes  to say, is richer  than ours,  and  he speaks,  
mar vellingly,  of this  richness  in  the  physical  and  biological  worlds,  the endless  
diversity  of  physical  forms  and  forms  of  life.
For  me,  as  a  physician ,  nature’ s  richness  is  to  be studied  in  the  phenomena 
 of  health  and  disease,  in  the endless  forms  of  individual  adaptation  by  which  human 
organisms,  people, adapt and reconstruct  themselves.
Defects,  disorders,  diseases,  in this sense, can  play
a  paradoxical  role,  by  bringing  out  latent  powers, developments,  evolutions,  forms  of 
 life,  that  might never  be seen,  or even  be  imaginable,  in  their  absence. It is the  
paradox  of  disease,  in this  sense,  its  “creative” potential,  that forms  the central  theme 
of  this book.

         Thus  while  one may  be horrified  by  the ravages  ot developmental  disorder  or  
disease,  one  may  sometimes see  them  as  creative  too—for  if  they  destroy  particular 
paths,  particular  ways  of  doing  things,  they  may  force the  nervous  system  into  making  
other  paths  and  ways,
force  on  it  an  unexpected  growth  and  evolution.  This other side of  development  or 
disease is something  I see, potentially,  in  almost every  patient;  and  it is this  which I am 
especially  concerned  to describe.
Similar  considerations  were  brought  up  by  A.  R.
Luria,  who  studied  the  long-term  survival  of  patients who  had  cerebral  tumors  or  
had  suffered  brain  injuries or strokes—and  the  way s,  the  adaptations,  they  used  to 
survive.  He  also  studied  deaf  and  blind  children  as  a very  young  man  (with  his  mentor 
 L.  S.  Vy gotsky).
Vygotsky  stressed  the intactness  rather  than  the deficits of such children:

A  handicapped  child  represents  a qualitatively  dif- ferent,  unique  type  of  development.... 
If  a  blind child  or  a  deaf  child  achieves  the  same  level  of
         development  as a normal  child,  then  the child  with a  defect  achieves  this  in  
another  way,  by  another course,  bother  means,  and, for  the  pedagogue,  it is 
particularly  important  to know  the uniqueness  of the  course  along  which  he  must  lead  the 
 child.
         This  uniqueness  transforms  the  minus  of  a  handicap into the plus of  
compensation.

That  such  radical  adaptations  could  occur  demanded, Luria thought,  a new  view of  the 
brain, a sense of  it not as  programmed  and  static,  but  rather  as  dynamic  and
active,  a supremely  efficient  adaptive system  geared  for evolution  and change,  
ceaselessly  adapting  to the needs of  the  organism—its  need,  above  all,  to  construct  a 
coherent  sell  and  world,  whatever  defects  or  disorders of  brain  function  befell  it.  
That  the  brain  is  minutely
differentiated  is  clear:  there  are  hundreds  of  tiny  areas crucial  for every aspect of  
perception  and behavior. The miracle  is  how  they  al1  cooperate,  are  inte grated together,  
in  the creation  of  a self.

This  sense  ot  the  brain’ s  remarkable  capacity  for the  most  striking  adaptations,  not  
least  in  the  special (and  often  desperate)  circumstances  of  neural  or  sen- sory  mishap,  
has  come  to  dominate  my  perception  of my  patients  and  their  lives.  So  much  so,  
indeed,  that  I am  sometime s  moved  to  wonder  whether  it  may  not  be
necessary  to  redefine  the  very  concepts  of  “health”  and “disease,”  to  see  these  in  
term s  of  the  ability  of  the organism  to  create  a  new  organization  and  order,  one that 
fits its special, altered  disposition  and  needs,  rather than in the terms of  a rigidly  
defined  “norm.”

Sickness  implies  a  contraction  of  life,  but  such contraction s  do  not  have  
to  occur.  Nearly  all  of  my patients,  so  it  seems  to  me,  whatever  their  problems, reach 
 out to life—and  not only  despite  their conditions, but often  because  of  them, and even  with 
their aid.

The  study  of  disease,  for  the  physician,  demands the  study  of  identity,  the 
 inner  worlds  that  patients, under  the  spur  of  illness,  create.  But  the  realities  of 
patients,  the  ways  in  which  they  and  their  brains  con- struct  their  o wn  w orl ds,   c 
an not  be  co mpr ehen ded
wholly  from  the  observation  of  behavior,  from  the  out- side.

With  this  in  mind,  I have  taken  off  my  white  coat, deserted,  by  and  large, the 
hospitals  where  I have spent the last twenty-five  years,  to explore  my  subjects'  lives
as they  live in the real world, feeling in part like a natu- ralist,  examining  rare  forms  
of  life;  in  part  like  an anthropologist, a  neuroanthropologist, in  the field—but most  of  
all  like  a  physician,  called  here  and  there  to make  house  call s,  house  c alls  at  the 
 far  borders  of
human  experience.
