Even then my only friends were made of paper
and ink. At school I had learned to read and write
long before the other children. Where my school
friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensible
pages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the
mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I
saw in them a key with which I could unlock a
boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those
streets, and those troubled days in which even I
could sense that only a limited fortune awaited me.
My father didn’t like to see books in the house.
There was something about them—apart from the
letters he could not decipher—that offended him.
He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would
send me off to work and that I’d better get rid of all
my scatterbrained ideas if I didn’t want to end up a
loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the
mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so
that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night
and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my
hands and flung it out of the window.
“If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading
all this nonsense, you’ll be sorry.”
My father was not a miser and, despite the
hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me
a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like

the other children. He was convinced that I spent
them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets,
but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed,
and when I’d collected four or five reales I’d secretly
rush out to buy myself a book.
My favorite place in the whole city was the
Sempere & Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It
smelled of old paper and dust and it was my
sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit
on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to
my heart’s content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay
for the books he placed in my hands, but when he
wasn’t looking I’d leave the coins I’d managed to
collect on the counter before I left. It was only small
change—if I’d had to buy a book with that pittance, I
would probably have been able to afford only a
booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me
to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on
my soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed
there forever.
One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I
have ever received. It was an old volume, read and
experienced to the full.
“Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens,” I read
on the cover.
I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who
frequented his establishment and, judging by the care
with which he handled the volume, I thought
perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them.
“A friend of yours?”
“A lifelong friend. And from now on, he’s your
friend too.”

That afternoon I took my new friend home,
hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn’t
see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead,
and I read Great Expectations about nine times,
partly because I had no other book at hand, partly
because I did not think there could be a better one in
the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that
Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was
convinced that I didn’t want to do anything else in
life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

The question of what to do with null
results—when researchers fail to see an effect that
should be detectable—has long been hotly debated
among those conducting medical trials, where the
results can have a big impact on lives and corporate
bottom lines. More recently, the debate has spread to
the social and behavioral sciences, which also have
the potential to sway public and social policy.
There were little hard data, however, on how often or
why null results were squelched. “Yes, it’s true that
null results are not as exciting,” political scientist
Gary King of Harvard University says. “But I suspect
another reason they are rarely published is that there
are many, many ways to produce null results by
messing up. So they are much harder to interpret.”
In a recent study, Stanford political economist
Neil Malhotra and two of his graduate students
examined every study since 2002 that was funded by
a competitive grants program called TESS
(Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences).
TESS allows scientists to order up Internet-based
surveys of a representative sample of US adults to test
a particular hypothesis (for example, whether voters
tend to favor legislators who boast of bringing federal
dollars to their districts over those who tout a focus
on policy matters).
Malhotra’s team tracked down working papers
from most of the experiments that weren’t published,
and for the rest asked grantees what had happened to
their results. In their e-mailed responses, some
scientists cited deeper problems with a study or more
pressing matters—but many also believed the
journals just wouldn’t be interested. “The
unfortunate reality of the publishing world [is] that
null effects do not tell a clear story,” said one
scientist. Said another, “Never published, definitely
disappointed to not see any major effects.”
Their answers suggest to Malhotra that rescuing
findings from the file drawer will require a shift in
expectations. “What needs to change is the
culture—the author’s belief about what will happen if
the research is written up,” he says.
Not unexpectedly, the statistical strength of the
findings made a huge difference in whether they
were ever published. Overall, 42% of the experiments

50

produced statistically significant results. Of those,
62% were ultimately published, compared with 21%
of the null results. However, the Stanford team was
surprised that researchers didn’t even write up
65% of the experiments that yielded a null finding.
Scientists not involved in the study praise its
“clever” design. “It’s a very important paper” that
“starts to put numbers on things we want to
understand,” says economist Edward Miguel of the
University of California, Berkeley.
He and others note that the bias against null
studies can waste time and money when researchers
devise new studies replicating strategies already
found to be ineffective. Worse, if researchers publish
significant results from similar experiments in the
future, they could look stronger than they should
because the earlier null studies are ignored. Even
more troubling to Malhotra was the fact that two
scientists whose initial studies “didn’t work out”
went on to publish results based on a smaller sample.
“The non-TESS version of the same study, in which
we used a student sample, did yield fruit,” noted one
investigator.
A registry for data generated by all experiments
would address these problems, the authors argue.
They say it should also include a “preanalysis” plan,
that is, a detailed description of what the scientist
hopes to achieve and how the data will be analyzed.
Such plans would help deter researchers from
tweaking their analyses after the data are collected in
search of more publishable results.

Inflexible old salt becomes a softy in the
nanoworld, stretching like taffy to more than twice
its length, researchers report. The findings may lead
to new approaches for making nanowires that could
end up in solar cells or electronic circuits. The work
also suggests that these ultra-tiny salt wires may
already exist in sea spray and large underground salt
deposits.
“We think nanowires are special and go to great
lengths to make them,” says study coauthor
Nathan Moore of Sandia National Laboratories in
Albuquerque. “Maybe they are more common than
we think.”
Metals such as gold or lead, in which bonding
angles are loosey-goosey, can stretch out at
temperatures well below their melting points.
But scientists don’t expect this superplasticity in a
rigid, crystalline material like salt, Moore says.
This unusual behavior highlights that different
forces rule the nanoworld, says theoretical physicist
Krzysztof Kempa of Boston College. “Forget about
gravity. It plays no role,” he says. Surface tension and
electrostatic forces are much more important at this
scale.
Moore and his colleagues discovered salt’s
stretchiness accidently. They were investigating how
water sticks to a surface such as salt and created a
super-dry salt sample for testing. After cleaving a
chunk of salt about the size of a sugar cube with a
razor, the scientists guided a microscope that detects
forces toward the surface. When the tip was far away
there was no measured force, but within about seven
nanometers a very strong attraction rapidly
developed between the diamond tip of the
microscope and the salt. The salt actually stretched
out to glom on to the microscope tip. Using an
electron microscope to see what was happening, the
researchers observed the nanowires.
The initial attraction between the tip and salt
might be due to electrostatic forces, perhaps good old
van der Waals interactions,1 the researchers

speculate. Several mechanisms might lead to the
elasticity, including the excessive surface tension
found in the nanoworld (the same tension that allows
a water strider to skim the surface of a pond).
The surface tension is so strong that as the
microscope pulls away from the salt, the salt
stretches, Kempa says. “The inside has no choice but
to rearrange the atoms, rather than break,” he says.
This bizarre behavior is actually mirrored in the
macroworld, the researchers say. Huge underground
deposits of salt can bend like plastic, but water is
believed to play a role at these scales. Perhaps salty
nanowires are present in these deposits as well.
“Sodium chloride2 is everywhere—in the air, in
our bodies,” Moore says. “This may change our view
of things, of what’s happening at the nanoscale.”
The work also suggests new techniques for
making nanowires, which are often created through
nano-imprinting techniques, Kempa says. “We
invoke the intuition of the macroworld,” he says.
“Maybe instead of stamping [nanowires] we should
be nano-pulling them.”

Mr. Lincoln likens that bond of the Federal
Constitution, joining Free and Slave States together,
to a house divided against itself, and says that it is
contrary to the law of God, and cannot stand.
When did he learn, and by what authority does he
proclaim, that this Government is contrary to the law
of God and cannot stand? It has stood thus divided
into Free and Slave States from its organization up to
this day. During that period we have increased from
four millions to thirty millions of people; we have
extended our territory from the Mississippi to the
Pacific Ocean; we have acquired the Floridas and
Texas, and other territory sufficient to double our
geographical extent; we have increased in population,
in wealth, and in power beyond any example on
earth; we have risen from a weak and feeble power to
become the terror and admiration of the civilized
world; and all this has been done under a
Constitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says is
in violation of the law of God; and under a Union
divided into Free and Slave States, which Mr. Lincoln
thinks, because of such division, cannot stand.
Surely, Mr. Lincoln is a wiser man than those who
framed the Government. . . .
I now come back to the question, why cannot this
Union exist forever, divided into Free and Slave
States, as our fathers made it? It can thus exist if each
State will carry out the principles upon which our
institutions were founded; to wit, the right of each
State to do as it pleases, without meddling with its
neighbors. Just act upon that great principle, and this
Union will not only live forever, but it will extend
and expand until it covers the whole continent, and
makes this confederacy one grand, ocean-bound
Republic. We must bear in mind that we are yet a
young nation, growing with a rapidity unequalled in
the history of the world, that our national increase is
great, and that the emigration from the old world is
increasing, requiring us to expand and acquire new
territory from time to time, in order to give our
people land to live upon. If we live upon the principle

In complaining of what I said in my speech at
Springfield, in which he says I accepted my
nomination for the Senatorship . . . he again quotes
that portion in which I said that “a house divided
against itself cannot stand.” Let me say a word in
regard to that matter. He tries to persuade us that
there must be a variety in the different institutions of
the States of the Union; that that variety necessarily
proceeds from the variety of soil, climate, of the face
of the country, and the difference in the natural
features of the States. I agree to all that. Have these
very matters ever produced any difficulty among us?
Not at all. Have we ever had any quarrel over the fact
that they have laws in Louisiana designed to regulate
the commerce that springs from the production of
sugar? Or because we have a different class relative to
the production of flour in this State? Have they
produced any differences? Not at all. They are the
very cements of this Union. They don’t make the
house a “house divided against itself.” They are the
props that hold up the house and sustain the Union.
But has it been so with this element of slavery?
Have we not always had quarrels and difficulties over
it? And when will we cease to have quarrels over it?
Like causes produce like effects. It is worth while to
observe that we have generally had comparative
peace upon the slavery question, and that there has
been no cause for alarm until it was excited by the
effort to spread it into new territory. Whenever it has
been limited to its present bounds, and there has
been no effort to spread it, there has been peace. All
the trouble and convulsion has proceeded from
efforts to spread it over more territory. It was thus at
the date of the Missouri Compromise. It was so again
with the annexation of Texas; so with the territory
acquired by the Mexican War; and it is so now.
Whenever there has been an effort to spread it there
has been agitation and resistance. . . . Do you think
that the nature of man will be changed, that the same

The Venus flytrap [Dionaea muscipula] needs to
know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves.
Closing its trap requires a huge expense of energy,
and reopening the trap can take several hours, so
Dionaea only wants to spring closed when it’s sure
that the dawdling insect visiting its surface is large
enough to be worth its time. The large black hairs on
their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to literally feel
their prey, and they act as triggers that spring the
trap closed when the proper prey makes its way
across the trap. If the insect touches just one hair, the
trap will not spring shut; but a large enough bug will
likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds,
and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.
We can look at this system as analogous to
short-term memory. First, the flytrap encodes the
information (forms the memory) that something (it
doesn’t know what) has touched one of its hairs.
Then it stores this information for a number of
seconds (retains the memory) and finally retrieves
this information (recalls the memory) once a second
hair is touched. If a small ant takes a while to get
from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten
the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against
the next hair. In other words, it loses the storage of
the information, doesn’t close, and the ant
happily meanders on. How does the plant encode
and store the information from the unassuming
bug’s encounter with the first hair? How does it
remember the first touch in order to react upon the
second?
Scientists have been puzzled by these questions
ever since John Burdon-Sanderson’s early report on
the physiology of the Venus flytrap in 1882. A
century later, Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers at
the University of Bonn in Germany proposed that
the flytrap stored information regarding how many
hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its
leaf. Their model is quite elegant in its simplicity.
In their studies, they discovered that touching a
trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric
action potential [a temporary reversal in the
electrical polarity of a cell membrane] that
induces calcium channels to open in the trap (this
coupling of action potentials and the opening of

calcium channels is similar to the processes that
occur during communication between human
neurons), thus causing a rapid increase in the
concentration of calcium ions.
They proposed that the trap requires a relatively
high concentration of calcium in order to close
and that a single action potential from just one
trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to
push the calcium concentration over this threshold
and spring the trap. The encoding of the information
requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium
so that a second increase (triggered by touching the
second hair) pushes the total concentration of
calcium over the threshold. As the calcium ion
concentrations dissipate over time, if the second
touch and potential don’t happen quickly, the final
concentration after the second trigger won’t be high
enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
Subsequent research supports this model.
Alexander Volkov and his colleagues at Oakwood
University in Alabama first demonstrated that it is
indeed electricity that causes the Venus flytrap to
close. To test the model they rigged up very fine
electrodes and applied an electrical current to the
open lobes of the trap. This made the trap close
without any direct touch to its trigger hairs (while
they didn’t measure calcium levels, the current
likely led to increases). When they modified this
experiment by altering the amount of electrical
current, Volkov could determine the exact electrical
charge needed for the trap to close. As long as
fourteen microcoulombs—a tiny bit more than the
static electricity generated by rubbing two balloons
together—flowed between the two electrodes, the
trap closed. This could come as one large burst or as
a series of smaller charges within twenty seconds. If it
took longer than twenty seconds to accumulate the
total charge, the trap would remain open.

resource with multiple practical uses. When utilized as a
garden fertilizer, compost provides nutrients to soil and
improves plant growth while deterring or killing pests
and preventing some plant diseases. It also enhances soil
texture, encouraging healthy roots and minimizing or
2 annihilating the need for chemical fertilizers. Better
than soil at holding moisture, compost minimizes water
waste and storm runoff, 3 it increases savings on
watering costs, and helps reduce erosion on
embankments near bodies of water. In large

collected for an entire municipality), compost can be
converted into a natural gas that can be used as fuel for

A Lion’s Share of Luck
It’s the beginning of February, and as they do every

New Year parade: the lion dance.
Experts agree that the lion dance originated in the
Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE); however, there is little

Also, if a witness mumbles, a human court reporter can

it necessary for the judge to make additional

of technology is “a transition from accurate records to

Despite the apparent benefits of using digital

Fire in Space
On Earth, fire provides light, heat, and comfort. Its
creation, by a process called combustion, requires a
chemical reaction between a fuel source and oxygen. The
shape that fire assumes on Earth is a result of
gravitational influence and the movement of molecules.
In the microgravity environment of space, 34 moreover,
combustion and the resulting fire behave in
fundamentally different ways than they do on
Earth—differences that have important implications for
researchers.
A group of engineering students from the University
of California at San Diego (UCSD), for example, 35 tried
to find a method to make their biofuel combustion study
(fuels derived from once-living material) free of the
drawbacks researchers face on Earth. The standard
method involves burning droplets of fuel, but Earth’s
gravitational influence causes the droplets to lose

results in subtle variations in density that both 37 causes
uneven heat flow and limits the size of the droplets that
can be tested. Specially designed “drop towers” 38 built
for this purpose reduce these problems, but they provide
no more than 10 seconds of microgravity, and droplet
size is still too small to produce accurate models of
combustion rates. 39 The UCSD students understood
that these limitations had to be surmounted. As part of
the program, researchers fly their experiments aboard
aircraft that simulate the microgravity environment of
space. The aircraft accomplish this feat by flying in
parabolic paths instead of horizontal ones. On the plane’s
ascent, passengers feel twice Earth’s gravitational pull, but

The larger, 43 spherically symmetric droplets burned
longer and gave the students more reliable data on
combustion rates of biofuels because the droplets’
uniform shape reduced the variations in density that
hinder tests performed in normal gravity. The students
hope the new data will aid future research by improving
theoretical models of biofuel combustion. Better
combustion-rate models may even lead to the production
of more fuel-efficient engines and improved
