The  known  Iacts,  as  they  are  pretty  much  univer- sally  accepted  among  biologists  and  
naturalists  today, are  that  all  the  eels  in  all  the  rivers  ot  eastern  North America  
and  the Caribbean  countries,  and all the eels in
all the rivers of  eastern  and  western  Europe,  are born  in the  same  area  of  the  
Sargasso  Sea,  a  huge  area  within the  Atlantic  Ocean,  between  Bermuda  and  the  Azores, 
the  surface  of  which  is frequently  covered  with  sargas- sum  seaweed.  In fact,  the  word  
“Sargasso”  comes  from
the  Portuguese  sargaqo,  meaning  seaweed.  The  sea  is about  2,0miles  long  and  
1,0miles  wide,  set  off from  the  surrounding  waters  of  the  Atlantic  by  strong 
currents.  It  includes  the  area  known  in  popular  legend as the Bermuda Triangle.

         Eels hatch  in  the Sargasso  as larvae and are carried by  the  ocean  currents  to  
either  Europe  or  the  United States,  a journey  that  can  cover  thousands  of  miles  and 
take years. Where they end  up depends on  which  of  two similar  species  they  belong  to.  
Those  that  are  An guilla
ang uilla  invariably   wind  up  in  European  rivers,  and those that enter North  American  
rivers always belong to the  species  Anguilla  rostrata.  The  first  person  to  find eel  larvae 
 in  the  Sargasso  Sea  was  Danish  researcher Johannes  Schmidt,  who  published  his findings  
in  1924,
after spending  18 years  hauling  nets in search  of  eels.
The  larvae  of  both  species  are  shaped  like  small oval  leaves  and  are  called  
leptocephali.  Each  lepto- cephalus  begins  to assume  the form  of  a  tiny eel, called an  
elver  or glass eel,  when  it gets  close  to the coasts  of
either  Europe  or  the  Americas.  By  the  time  it  reaches brackish  water,  where fresh 
and salt water mix, it is thin and  transparent,  hardly  bigger  than  a hair,  with  a pair of 
eyes like black dots at one end.
From  the  estuaries  and  mouths  of  rivers,  the  tiny
eels   t requently   continue   upstream,   particularly   the females,  who  sometimes  go  
great  distances  inland. American  eels  have  been  found  as  far  up  the  Miss is- sippi  
River  system  as  the  rivers  of  Iowa.  They  keep going   upriver   until   something   tell s  
 them   they’ ve
reached  home,  and  then  they  stop.  Whatever  it  is  that signals  to  eels  that  they  
are  home  is  definitive—they settle  in and  live  there  for as long  as  years,  growing up 
to a yard long  before beginning  their journey  back  to the  S argas so  S ea.   Scientists  
determine  an  ee1’s  age
using  a  microscope   to  read  the  growth   rings  of  its otolith—a  small,  hard  calcium  
deposit  at the base of  its skull.

In  preparation  for  the  return  journey  to  the  Sar- gasso, sexually  mature female eels feed 
voraciously  and
change  color  from  the  muddy-yellow/green  of  adult eels,  often  called  yellow  eels,  to 
 a  darker  green  on  top and  snow-white  on  their  bellies.  At  this  stage,  they  are called 
 silver  eels.  They  swim  downriver  in  the  fall,  on the  first  leg  of  their  journey  to  
the  Sargasso,  and  when

they  reach  estuarine  waters,  they  rest,  completing  their final  transformation as silver 
eels. They  will have eaten heavily  and  will  be  about  percent  body  fat.  They will  
never  eat  again,  and  their  digestive  systems  will atrophy.  Their  pupils  will  expand  and 
 turn  blue.  They
will  need  a  new  kind  of  sight  adapted  to  the  depths  of the  sea,  where  there  is  
little  light.  They  will  also  have to go through  a drastic  adjustment,  via osmosis,  in 
their blood  chemistry,  to  prepare  for  the  tremendous  change in  water  pressure,  going from 
some 14 pounds  of  fresh-
water  pressure  per  inch  of  their  bodies  to  over  a  ton  of ocean  pressure  per  inch. 
 Once  they  are  back  in  the Sar- gasso  Sea,  the  females  produce  eggs  for  the  males  to 
fertilize, and then  the adults die.
At  least  that  is  what  today's  marine  biologists  and
naturalists  tell  us,  although  adult  eels  have  never  been seen  swimming,  reproducing,  
or  dying  in  the Sargasso. In fact, live adult eels have never  been  seen  there at all. The  
only  two  adult  eels  ever  reported  in  the  Sargasso Sea were dead, found  in  the stomachs  
of  other fish. The
eel's  migration  back  to  its  birthplace  and  what  it  actu- ally  does  when  it  gets  
there  are  assumed  to  take  place far  below  the  water's  surface  and,  as  of  the  year  
2001, were  stil1  completely  unobserved.   However,  the  eel larvae—the  leptocephali  that 
Schmidt  found  in the Sar-
gasso—were  so  small  that  it  was  certain  they  had  been born  recently,  and  nearby. 
Such  small larvae have never been  seen  elsewhere,  and  while  eels  have  never  been observed  
reproducing  in  the  Sargasso,  they  have  never been  seen  doing  so  an yp1ace  else  either.  
Scientists
believe  the  larvae  hatch  out  of  eggs  at  a  depth  of 100-3yards  and  rise  slowly  
toward  the  light  at  the sea's surface.
