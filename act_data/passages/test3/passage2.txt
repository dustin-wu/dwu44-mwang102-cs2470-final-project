Speak  the  words  “ice  age,”  and  the  mind  turns  to Cro-Magnon  mammoth  hunters on windswept 
 European plains  devoid  ot  trees.  But  the  Little  Ice  Age  (approx i- mately  A.D.  
1300—1850)  was  far  from  a  deep  freeze.
Think  instead  of  an  irregular  seesaw  of  rapid  climatic shifts,  driven  by  complex  and 
 still  little  understood interactions  between  the atmosphere  and the ocean. The seesaw  
brought  cycles  of  intensely  cold  winters  and easterl y   winds,   then   switched   abru ptl 
y  to  years   ot
heavy  spring  and  early  summer rains,  mild  winters,  and frequent  A tl anti c  storms,  
or  to  peri ods  ot  droughts, light  northeasterly  winds,  and  summer  heat  waves  that baked  
growing  corn  tields  under  a  shimmering  haze. The  Little  Ice  Age  was  an  endless  zigzag  
of  climatic
shifts,  tew  lasting  more  than  a  quarter  century.  Today's prolonged  warming  is an 
anomaly.

Reconstructing  the  climate  changes  of  the  past  is extremely  ditficult,  because  reliable  
instrument  records are  but  a  few  centuries  old.  For  earlier  times,  we  have
but  what  are  called  proxy  records  reconstructed  from incomplete  written  accounts,  
tree  rings,  and  ice  cores. Country  clergy  and  amateur  scientists  with  time  on their  
hands  sometimes  kept  weather  records  over  long periods.  Chronicles  like those  of  the 
eighteenth-century
diarist John  Evelyn  or  monastery  scribes  are invaluable for  their  remarks  on  unusual  
weather,  but  their  useful- ness  in  making  comparisons  is  limited.  Remarks  like “the worst 
 rain  storm in memory,”  or “hundreds  of  fish- ing  boats  over whelmed  by  mighty  waves”  do  
not  an
accurate meteorological record  make, even if  they  made a  deep  impression  at  the  time.  
The  traumas  of  extreme weather  events  fade rapidly  from  human  consciousness. Many  New  Yor 
kers  still  v ividly  remember  the  great heat  wave  of  Summer  1999,  but  it  will  soon  
fade  from
collective  memory,  just  like  the  great  New  York  bliz- zard  of  1888,  which  stranded  
hundreds  of  people  in Grand  Central  station  and froze dozens  to death  in  deep snowdrilts.
A generation  ago,  we had a generalized  impression
of  Little  Ice  Age  climate  compiled  with  pain staking care  from  a  bewildering  array  
of  historical  sources  and a  handful  of  tree-ring  sequences.  Today,  the  scatter  of 
tree-ring  records  has  become hundreds  from  throughout the  Northern  Hemisphere  and  many  
from  south  of  the
equator,  too,  amplified  with  a growing  body  of  temper- ature  data  from  ice  cores  
drilled  in  Antarctica,  Green- land,  the  Peruvian  Andes,  and  other  locations.  We  can now  
track  the  Little  Ice  Age  as  an  intricate  tapestry  of short-term climatic  shifts that 
rippled  through European
society  during  times  of  remarkable  change—centuries that  saw  Europe  emerge  from  
medieval  fieldom  and pass by stages  through  the Renaissance,  the Age of  Dis- covery,  the  
Enlightenment,  the  French  and  Industrial revolutions,  and the making of  modern  Europe.


         To  what  extent  did  those  climatic  shifts  alter  the course  of  European  
history?  Many  archaeologists  and historians  are  suspicious  ot  the  role  of  climate  change 
in  changing  human  societies—and  with  good  reason. Environ mental  determini s m,  the  n 
otion  that  cli mate
change  was  a  primary  cau se  of  major  developments like, say,  agriculture,  has been a 
dirty  word  in academia for generations.  You  certainly  cannot  argue  that  climate drove  
history  in a direct  and  causative  way  to  the  point of  toppling  governments.  Nor,  
however,  can  you  con-
tend  that  climate  change  is  something  that  you  can totally  ignore.  Throughout  the  
Little  Ice  Age,  into  the nineteenth  century,  millions  of  European  peasants  lived at  the  
subsi stence  level.  Their  survival  depended  on crop  yields:  cycles  of  good  and  poor  
harvests,  of  cooler
and  wetter  spring  weather,  could  make  a  crucial  differ- ence  between  hunger  and  
plenty,  life  and  death.  The sufficienc y  or  ins ufficienc y  of  food  was  a  powerful 
motivator  of  human  action,  sometimes  on  a  national  or even   continent- wide   s cale,   
with   con sequence s  that
could  take decades  to unfold.

Consider,    Ior   instance,    the   food   crises    that engulfed  Europe  during  the  Little  
Ice  Age—the  great hunger  of  13to  1319,  the  food  dearths  of  1741,  and 1 S 16,  “the  
year  without  a  summer”—to  mention  only  a
few.  These  crises  in  themselves  did  not  threaten  the continued  existence  of  Western  
civilization,  but  they surely  played  an  important  role  in  the  formati on  of modern  
Europe.  Some  of  these  crises  resulted  from  cli- matic shifts, others from human  ineptitude  
or disastrous
economic  or  political  policy;  many  from  a combination of  all  three.  Environmental  
determinism  may  be  intel- lectually  bankrupt,  but  climate  change  is  the  ignored player on 
the historical  stage.
