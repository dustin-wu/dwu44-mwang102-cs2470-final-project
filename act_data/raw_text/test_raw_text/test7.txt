Passage I

LITERARY   NARRATIVE:   Passage  A  is  adapted   from   the memoir  The  Piano  Shop  on  the  
Left  Bank  by  Thad  Carhart (Oc2001 by T.E. Carhart).  Passage  B is adapted from the article “Me 
and My  Violin” by  Arnold  Steinhardt  (Oc2014 by Listen: Life with Classical Music).

Passage  A by Thad Carhart

Even  when  Luc  was  busy  and  could  not  talk  he always  made  me  welcome  and  allowed  me  
to  wander around  the inner sanctum  of  the back room on  my  own. When  things  were  quieter,  
he  seemed  glad  of  the  com-
5  pany  and  would  tell  me  about  the  pianos  that  had  just arrived.  Our  talks  made  real 
 for  me  one  of  his  funda- mental  beliefs,  that  each  and  every  piano  had  com- pletely  
individual  characteristics,  even  if  of  the  same manufacturer  and age.
10           Sometimes  he  knew  all  the  details,  had  even  met the owners and  talked  about  
their  instrument  with  them and  knew  intimately  how  they  had  treated  it.  Other times  he 
knew  nothing  beyond  what  he  could  see,  feel, or  hear.  Most  often  pianos  came  to  him  
from  auctions
15  and  charity  sales,  their  history  anonymous.  But  even then,  like an expert in artifacts, 
 he could  deduce  a great deal:  whether  a  piano  had  been  played  much  or  little, whether  
it had  been  in  an  environment  with  the  proper level  of  humidity  (one  of  his  cardinal  
rules),  whether
20  there  had  been  children  in  the  household,  even  whether it  had  recently  been  
transported  by  ship.  (“The  worst thing  you  can  possibly  do to a piano,”  he  told  me  more 
than  once.)  At  these  moments  he  was  part  detective, part archaeologist, part social critic.
25           His  attitude  about  how  people  treated  their  pianos seemed  to  mirror  his  
philosophy  of  life.  While  regret- ting  the depredations  worked  by  children  on  keyboards 
and  strings,  he  regarded  them  as  tolerable  because  the piano  was at least  used  and,  as 
he  put it,  “au  sein de  la
30  famille”  (“at the heart of  the family”).  It was more  than just  any  piece  of  furniture,  
but  it  was  that,  too,  and  if drinks  were  spilled  and  stains  bit  into  shiny  finishes,  
it was  the  price  one  paid  for initiating  the  young  to a  joy that should  stem from 
familiarity  rather than reverence.
35           Those  who  preserved  their  piano  as  an  altar  upon which  the  art  of  music  
was  to  be  worshipped  irritated

Luc,  but  he  was  deeply  respectful  of  serious  musicians who  used  and  depended  upon  
their  instrument  for  their livelihood.
Passage B by Arnold Steinhardt

40            Marc  Lifschey,  one  of  the  greatest  oboists  of  his era,   told  me   that   
after  retiring   as  a  performer   and teacher,  he  sold his oboe. On  the face of it, giving  
up an instrument  you  no  longer  use  seems  perfectly  reason- able,  but  nevertheless  I  was  
taken  aback.  Marc  was  not
45  merely  an  excellent  oboist;  he  was  a  great  artist.  Still, Marc  didn't do it alone. He 
 and his oboe did it together. Even  in  retirement,  wouldn't  Marc  have  some  sort  of lasting  
relationship  with  his  oboe  that  transcended  per- forming  on  it?  Wouldn't  he  want  to  
keep  it  if  for  no
50  other  reason   than  as  a  reminder  of  the  magnificent music  the  two of them had made  
together?
Joseph Roisman,  the distinguished  first  violinist  of the  Budapest  String  Quartet,  seemed  
to  be  content  to give  up his beloved Lorenzo  Storioni  when he agreed  to
55  sell it  to me after  the Quartet  retired.  But  when I  finally met  with  him,  he  had  
second  thoughts.  “Steinhardt,”  he said  to  me  plaintively,  “I’11  sell  the  violin  to  you  
some day,  but  for  now  I’m   enjoying  playing  chamber  music with my  friends  every Friday  
night.”  And  that is exactly
60  what he did until his death a year or two later.
Lifschey  and  Roisman  dealt with retirement  in dif- ferent ways, but their stories made me 
wonder about not only  what  I'll  do  with  my  violin  if  and  when  I  retire, but  also  about 
 the  very  nature  of  a  musician's  day-to-
65  day,  year-to-year  relationship  with his instrument.
I  began  playing  violin  when  I  was  six  years  old, and  now  I’m   seventy-six.  It has been 
 an integral  part  of my  life  for  the  last  seven  decades.  Does  that  make  the violin  my  
very  close  friend?  Well,  yes.  Sometimes.  The
70  violin obviously  can't  speak  with  words,  but  when I  ask something  of  it,  the  
instrument  can  respond  with  an astonishing  range  of  substance  and  emotion.  This  is 
friendship  on a most exalted  level.
There   are   other   moments,   however,   when   the
75  violin  stubbornly  refuses  to  do  my  bidding—when   it only  reluctantly  plays  in  tune,  
or  makes  the  sound  I want,  or delivers  the  music’s  essence  for  which I  strive. Then  I  
have  to  cajole,  bargain  or  adjust  to  its  every

whim.  Some  friend;  more  like  an  adversary,  you  might 80  say.
Or  is  the  violin  my  partner?  A  woman  once  went backstage  to  congratulate  the  great  
violinist  Jascha Heifetz  after  a concert.  “What  a wonderful  sound  your



violin has, Mr. Heifetz!”  she exclaimed.  Heifetz  leaned 85  over his violin that lay in its open 
case, listened intently for  a  moment,  and  said,  “Funny,  I  don't  hear  a  thing.”
My violin also lies mute in its case without me—but, on the  other  hand,  I stand  mute  on  the  
concert  stage  with- out it.

adversary  by stating that it:
A.   lies mute in its case.
B.   makes him adjust to its whims.
C.   responds with a range of emotion.
D.   can't speak with words.

8.  Compared  to  Passage  A,  Passage  B  is  more  directly focused on the:

expects   his musicians  to travel long distances.

19.  It  can  most  reasonably  be  inferred  from  the  passage that  Holmes's  band  members

Passage III

INFORMATIONAL:  This  passage  is  adapted  from  the  article “Photography  Changes  How Cultural  
Groups  Are  Represented and Perceived”  by  Edwin  Schupman  (Oc2012  by The  Smithson- ian 
Institution).

The author  of the passage is a citizen of the Muscogee  (Creek) Nation of Oklahoma.

Using  photographs  as  educational  resources  pre- sents particular  challenges  and  must  be 
done  with  care. There  is always  more  than  face  value in any  photo,  and historical  photos 
of  American  Indians are no exception.
5  Photography's  rise  in  the  late  nineteenth  century  coin- cided  with  great  change  in  
American  Indian  communi- ties—an  era  that  capped  over  three  hundred  years  of diseases,  
wars,  cultural  disruption,  and  land  disposses- sion.  As  Indian   people   struggled   to  
adapt   to  cata-
10  strophic    changes    to    their    old    ways    of    living, photographers  took  
thousands  of  studio  portraits  and made  what  they  believed  to  be  neutral  ethnographic 
images  of  the  “vanishing  Indian.”  As  Indian  cultures bent   under   pressure   to  
assimilate   into  mainstream
15  America,  photographers  routinely  captured  images  that compared  the  new  “civilized”  
Indian  to  the  tradition- bound  “savages.”  Indian  delegations  that  traveled  to Washington,  
D.C.,  to  defend  tribal  treaty  rights  were

In  another  well-known  studio  portrait,  circa  1890, Goyathlay  poses with a rifle. To 
late-nineteenth-century Americans,  Geronimo  was  a  dangerous  enemy,  yet  at the  same  time  a 
 curiosity  and  romantic  symbol  of  the “Wild West.”  This photo personifies  the renegade image 
but, strangely,  it was taken about  two to four years after Goyathlay  surrendered—while  he  was  
a  prisoner  of war.  Why,  then,  was  this  photo  taken?  What  meaning did  it  convey  at  the 
 time?  What  must  have  been  in
60  Goyathlay's  mind? What does the photo mean today? Is it  loaded  with  historical  truths  or  
is  it  as  empty  as  the prisoner's bullet chamber?
A  few  years  later,  Goyathlay  was  photographed again,  this  time  in  a  more  pastoral  pose 
 and  place—
65  holding  a  melon  in  a garden  with  his  wife  and  three  of their   children.   What   was 
  the   meaning   behind   this photo? Did  people  of  the  time  see  it as a simple family 
photo,  or  did  it  personify   the  government's   policy toward  Indians  at  the  time—subduing 
 feared  and  hated
70  warriors,  “re-educating”  them,  and  teaching  them  to farm  in  order  to  guide  them  
toward  a  “better”  way  of life? Ironically,  the Apaches  had  long farmed  as part of the 
traditional  life they fought so tenaciously  to protect.
The  educational  potential  of  photographs  is  enor-
75  mous. However,  photographs  are not objective; they can easily  tell as  many  lies as  
truths.  As  much  as any  writ-

photographed  in  studios  and  in  front  of  federal  build-
20  ings.   Photographers   also   accompanied   government expeditions  to  the  West  where  they 
 documented  tradi- tional  cultures,  leading  the  way  for  tourists  and  com- mercial  
photographers  who  followed,  carrying  their cameras and preconceptions into Native American com-
25  munities.  These  efforts  generated  a  legacy  of  photo- graphic  images  of  American  
Indian  people  that  can serve  today  as  rich  educational  resources.  But  if  used 
carelessly,  they  can  also  fuel  romanticized  and  stereo- typical perceptions  of American 
Indians.
30           Consider   some   of   the   many   photographs   of Goyathlay,   the  Apache   man   
who  Mexicans   named “Geronimo.”  He and other Chiricahua Apaches fought a protracted  war  from  
1863  to  1886  against  the  United States for the right to live in their traditional  homelands
35  rather than on reservations.
The  Chiricahua  Apaches   fight  for  freedom  cap— tured  the  American  imagination  in  the  
late  nineteenth century.  “Geronimo,”  especially,  became  a  legendary figure  and  a  media  
phenomenon   whose  legacy  has
40  lasted  into  the  twenty-first  century.  He  became  synony- mous  with  courage,  daring,  
and  savage  ruthlessness. World  War  II  paratroopers  shouted  his  name  as  they jumped  from  
airplanes  into  combat.  Movies,  television shows,  comic  books,  popular  songs,  posters,  
T-shirts,
45  and  American  cities  have  borne  his  image  and  name. One photo that shows Goyathlay  and 
three other Chiric- ahuas  in  their  camp  just  prior  to  surrendering  to  U.S. forces in 1886 
documents  a critical and difficult day for the   people   who  had   fought   so  diligently   for 
  their
50  freedom.

ten document,  they have to be read  with care in order  to be    understood    accurately    in    
unbiased    and    non- stereotypical  terms. Every  photo of  people contains his-
80  tory,  culture,  and  context.  To  do  justice  to  the  subjects and  their  stories,  it  is 
 crucial  to  fill  in  the  information gaps.  In  addition  to  conducting  background  research, 
try  putting  yourself  inside  these  photos—stand  next  to Goyathlay,  his  peers,  his  wife,  
and  their  children,  and
85  imagine  their  lives—you  might  begin  to  understand  the world  from  their  points  of  
view.  Framed  with  factual information  and  viewed  empathetically,  each  photo- graph  can  
reach  its  richest  potential  as  a  significant educational  opportunity  and resource.







21.  Which  of  the  following  rhetorical  techniques  does  the author  repeatedly   use  in  the 
 passage  as  a  means  to engage  the reader?
A.   Forthright  attacks  on  what  he  labels  as  readers' misunderstanding of basic historical 
fact
B.   Open-ended   questions   and   appeals  directed   to readers
C.   Direct  quotations  from  past  readers  of  his  work that capture  their responses  to his 
ideas
D.   Descriptions  of  his own experiences  as a citizen  of the Muscogee  (Creek)  Nation  of  
Oklahoma

A.   accurately  understanding  a photograph  depends on knowing  the circumstances  in  which a 
photograph was taken.
B.   photographs  can  be used  to date  events  in  the  life of a legendary figure like 
Goyathlay.
C.   anyone   can   control   his   or   her   public   image by   becoming   more   involved   in  
 the   field   of photography.
D.   the  merits  of  a  photograph  from  the  nineteenth century depend on who took the 
photograph.

26.  The  author  most  strongly  suggests  that  one  reason commercial  photographers  began  to 
photograph  Native American  communities  was that commercial  photogra- phers were:

Passage IV

INFORMATIONAL:  This  passage  is  adapted  from  Summer World: A Season of  Bounty  by Bernd 
Heinrich (Oc2009 by Bernd Heinrich).

Adaptations  of  plants  to deserts  include  dormancy and  a  variety  of  structural  and  
behavioral  adaptations. The  majority  of  desert  plants  depend  on  a strategy  that 
capitalizes  on  small  size.  They  are  annuals  that  spring
5  up  from  dry,  dormant,  heat-resistant  seeds.  Some  of these  seeds  may  wait  up  to  half 
 a  century  before  they are  activated.  The  plants'   challenge  is  to  be  quick enough  to 
respond  to rain so that they can  produce  their seeds before  the earth dries up again,  while 
not jumping
10  the gun  to start growth  until there is sufficient  water for them  to  grow  to  maturity  
for  seed  production.  Some achieve  this  balance  on  a  tightrope  by  “measuring” rainfall.  
They  have  chemicals  in their  seeds  that inhibit germination,  and a minimum amount  of  rain 
is required
15  before  these  are  leached  out.  Others  have  seed  coats that  must  be  mechanically  
scarred  to  permit  sufficient wetting  for  germination,  and  the  scarring  happens  only when  
they  are  subjected  to flash  floods in the riverbeds where  they  grow.  A  plant  in  the  
Negev  Desert  releases
20  its  seed  from  a  tough  capsule  only  under  the  influence of  water  through  a  
mechanism  that resembles  a  Roman ballistic  machine.  Its  two  outer  sepals  generate  side- 
ways  tension  that  can  fling  two  seeds  out  of  the  fruit, but  the  two  seeds  are  held  
inside  by  a lock  mechanism
25  at  the  top.  However,  when  the  sepals  are  sufficiently wetted,  then  the tension  
increases  to such  an extent  that the  lock  mechanism  snaps,  and  the  capsule  “explodes” and 
releases the seeds.
In moist regions  where  it rains predictably  (though 30  not  necessarily   in  abundance),   we  
help  agricultural plants  to capture  the precipitation  by  scarring  the  soil to facilitate  
the  infiltration  of  the  water  into  it,  and  hence into  the roots. Least runoff  and maximum 
 water  absorp- tion  are  achieved  by  plowing  the  soil.  However,  such  a
35   strategy  would  not  work  in  a  true  desert  such  as  the Negev.  A  different  program  
is  required  there  because rain  is  infrequent  and  plowing  would  facilitate  only  the 
evaporation  of  scarce  water  from  the  soil.  The  solution applied  by  the peoples  who 
inhabited  the Negev  in past
40  centuries  was  a  practice  they  called  “runoff  farming.” Farmers  had  mastered  
harnessing   the  flash  floods  that rush  down  into  the  gullies  by  catching  the  
runoffs—not only  by  making  terraces  but  also  by  building  large  cis- terns  into  which  
the  water  was  directed  to  be  held  for
45  later use. Remnants  of these  constructions  still exist.
Water-storage  mechanisms  have  been  invented  by other  organisms  living  in  deserts,  but  
mainly  through modifications  of  body  plan.  Many  plants,  especially cacti and euphorbia,  
have  the ability  to swell their roots

transferred  into  its  tall  trunk.  This  trunk  is  pleated  like an  accordion  and  can  swell 
 to  store  tons  of  water  that can  last  the  plant  for  a  year.  The cactus  has  no  
leaves, but  the  stem  is green  and  can  photosynthesize  and  pro-
60  duce nutrients as well as store water. The saguaro's sur- vival  strategy  requires  it to grow 
 extremely  slowly.  But it lives a century or more.
Some  desert  animals  similarly  store  water.  The frog  C yc'lorunu  plat yc'ephulu,  from  the  
northern  Aus-
65  tralian  desert,  fills  up  and  greatly  expands  its  urinary bladder  to  use  as  a  water 
 bag  before  burying  itself  in the  soil,  where  it  spends  most  of  the  year  waiting  for 
the  next  rain.  While  in  the  ground  it  sloughs  off  skin and forms  around  itself a nearly 
 waterproof  cocoon  that
70  resembles  a  plastic  bag  and  reduces  evaporative  water loss.

Desert  ants  of  a  variety   of  species  (of  at  least seven  different  genera)  in  American  
as  well  as  Aus- tralian  deserts  collectively  called  “honeypot  ants”  have
75  evolved  a  solution  that  combines  water  storage  with energy   storage.   Ants  typically  
 feed  each  other;  and some  of  the  larger  worker  ants  may  take  up more  liquid than  the  
others,  and  others  may  bring  more.  Those  that take  the  fluid  may  gorge  themselves  
until  they  distend
80  their  abdomens  up to the  size  of a grape,  by  which  time they  are  unable  to  move  
from  the  spot.  They  then  hang in  groups  of  dozens  to  hundreds  from  the  ceiling  of  a 
chamber  in  the  ant  nest,  where  they  are  then  the  spe- cialized  so-called  repletes  that 
 later  regurgitate  fluid
85  when  the  colony  members  are  no  longer  bringing   the fluid in but rather needing  it.






31.  The fourth  paragraph  (lines 63-71) marks a shift in the focus of  the passage from:
A.   plants  that  store  water  above  ground  to plants  that store water below  ground.
B.   animals  that  don't  go  dormant  to  animals  that  do go dormant.
C.   desert-dwelling plants to desert-dwelling animals.
D.   inhabitants  of  the  Negev  Desert  to  inhabitants  of northern Australian  deserts.


50  or stems with water stores. Possibly  the most familiar is the  saguaro cactus,  Carnegiea  
gigantea, of  the Sonoran desert  in  the American  southwest.  It  has a shallow  root system  
that  extends  in  all  directions  to  distances  of about  its  height,  fifty  feet.  In  one  
rainstorm  the  root
55  system  can  soak  up  200  gallons  of  water,  which  are

levels in the soil.

32.  Based  on  the  passage,  the  author's  use  of  the  word “measuring”  (line  12)  most  
nearly  describes  the  way that some desert plants:
F.    have  roots  that are extremely  sensitive  to moisture
G.   have  methods  of  delaying seed  germination  until a certain amount of  water is present.
H.   are visibly  more  vigorous after a rainfall.
J.     can  calculate  how  many  inches  of  rain  have  fallen in recent days.

33.  Which of the following  statements  best summarizes  the process by  which  the frog  C 
yc'lorunu plutyc'ephulu  survives in the desert?
A.   The frog stores water in its body,  buries itself, and conserves  water until emerging at the 
next rain.
B.   The frog  buries itself,  waits for rain, absorbs  rain- water through its skin, and emerges.
C.   The frog forms a nearly  waterproof  cocoon around itself,  buries  itself,  and  waits  to  
emerge  until  it needs water.
D.   The  frog  buries  itself,  absorbs  water  through  its skin, and goes dormant until 
springtime.

34.  Based  on  the  passage,  which  of  the  following  plants and animals employ  a communal  
strategy  to survive in the desert?
F.    The saguaro cactus only
G.   The  saguaro  cactus  and  the frog  C yc'lorana  plat y- c’ephal‹i  only
H.   The  frog  C yc'lorana  plat yc'e phala  and  honeypot ants only
J.    Honeypot ants only

35.  The  passage  most  strongly  suggests  that  compared  to the frog  C yc'lorunu plut 
yc'ephulu,  the honeypot  ants are unique in that  they:
A.   can store water inside their bodies.
B.   live in Australian deserts.
C.   combine water storage with energy storage.
D.   go dormant during dry times.

36.  Which of  the following  provides the best paraphrase of lines 7-11?
F.    Annual  plants  survive  in  deserts  by  making  seeds swiftly  when conditions are right.
G.   Annual  plants  in  deserts  make  seeds  during  dry conditions  so  the  seeds  will  be  
ready  when  rain arrives.
H.   Dry conditions  require the seeds of desert plants to start germination  prior to the arrival 
of rain.
J.    The seeds of  annual  plants  in deserts  are designed to wait years for the right conditions 
for growth.

37.  Based   on   the  passage,   it   can   most   reasonably   be inferred  that  the  scarring  
some  seeds  require  before germination  is accomplished  through:
A.   intense drying experienced between  rainfalls.
B.   internal tension from the seed capsule's sepals.
C.   chemicals in the seeds.
D.   abrasion  sustained during flash floods.




38.  As  it  is  used  in  line  26,  the  word  extent  most  nearly means:
F.    length.
G.   degree.
H.   reach.
J.     boundary.




39.  According   to  the  passage,   which  of   the  following actions  did people  in the Negev  
Desert  take in order  to farm there?
A.   Plowing  the soil
B.   Widening  gullies
C.   Constructing  terraces
D.   Constructing aqueducts




40.  Based  on  the  passage,  the  pleats  in  the  body  of  the saguaro cactus:
F.    increase the efficiency  of photosynthesis.
G.   allow the cactus to expand for storing  water.
H.   reduce evaporative  water loss.
J.    regulate the cactus's growth.
