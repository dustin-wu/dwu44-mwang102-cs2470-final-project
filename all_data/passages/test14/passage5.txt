“Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we
can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a
human health crisis,” says biochemist Kim Lewis of
Northeastern University.
Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a
promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the
powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests,
teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide
variety of disease-causing bacteria—even those that
have developed immunity to other drugs. The
scientists’ best efforts to create mutant bacteria with
resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin
could function effectively for decades before
pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.
Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria
and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic
drug development during the past century. But only
about one percent of these organisms can be grown
in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, have
remained uncultured and of limited use to medical
science, until now. “Instead of trying to figure out the
ideal conditions for each and every one of the
millions of organisms out there in the environment,
to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply grow
them in their natural environment where they
already have the conditions they need for growth,”
Lewis says.
To do this, the team designed a gadget that
sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,
each perforated with pores that allow molecules like
nutrients to diffuse through but don’t allow the
passage of cells. “We just use it to trick the bacteria
into thinking that they are in their natural
environment,” Lewis says.
The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil
bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could
be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.
Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.
Mice infected with bacteria that cause upper
respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus
aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated
with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the
infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
It’s likely that teixobactin is effective because of
the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down
bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules
that the cell creates organically. Many other
antibiotics target the bacteria’s proteins, and the
genes that encode those proteins can mutate to
produce different structures.
Many good antibiotic families—penicillin,
streptomycin, tetracycline—come from soil fungi
and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if
we could grow more types of bacteria from soil—or
from exotic environments, such as deep
oceans—then we might find new natural antibiotics.
In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others]
found that they could isolate and grow individual soil
bacteria—including types that can’t normally be
grown in the laboratory—in soil itself, which
supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the
bacteria reached a critical mass they could be
transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued.
This simple and elegant methodology is their most
important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway
to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibioticproducing bacteria that have never been grown
before.
The first new antibiotic that they’ve found by this
approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called
Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though
it doesn’t look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive
bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and
cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed
the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important
because there is a real problem with resistant
tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also
difficult to select teixobactin resistance.
So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First,
teixobactin isn’t a potential panacea. It doesn’t kill
the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to
cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to
commercial manufacture will be challenging, since
the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to
grow. And, thirdly, it’s early days yet. As with any
antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of
clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely
give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections,
and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of
“standard of care treatment.” That’s going to take
five years and £500 million and these are numbers we
must find ways to reduce (while not compromising
safety) if we’re to keep ahead of bacteria, which can
evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.
