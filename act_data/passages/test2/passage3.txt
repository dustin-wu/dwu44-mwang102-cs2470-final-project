The  interior life  is often  stupid.  Its egoism  blinds  it and  deafens  it;  its  imagination  
spins  out  ignorant  tales, fascinated.  It fancies  that the western  wind blows on  the Self,  
and  leaves  fall  at  the  feet  of  the  Self  for  a  reason,
5  and  people  are  watching.  A  mind  risks  real  ignorance for   the   sometimes   paltry   
prize   of   an   imagination enriched.  The trick  ot reason  is to get the imagination  to seize 
the actual  world—if  only from time to time.
When  I  was  five,  I  would  not  go  to  bed  willingly
because  something  came into my  room.  My sister  Amy, two  years  old,  was  asleep  in  the 
 other  bed.  What  did she  know?  She  was  in nocent  of  evi1.  There  was  n o messiness  in  
her,  no  roughnes s  for  things  to  cling  to, only  a  charming  and  charmed  innocence  that  
seemed
then  to  protect  her,  an  innocence  I  needed  but  couldn’t muster.  Since  Amy  was  
asleep,  turthermore,  and  since when   I  needed   someone   mo st  I   was   afraid   to  s tir 
enough  to wake her, she was useless.
I  lay  alone  and  was  almost  asleep  when  the  thing
entered  the  room  by  flattening  itself  against  the  open door  and  sliding  in.  It  was 
 a  transparent,  luminous oblong. I could  see the door  whiten  at its touch;  I could see  the  
blue  wall  turn  pale  where  it  raced  over  it,  and see  the  maple  headboard  of  Amy’ s  
bed  glow.  It  was  a
swift  spirit;  it  was  an  awareness.  It  made  noise.  It  had two  joined  parts,  a  head 
 and  a  tail.  It  found  the  door, wall, and  headboard;  and it swiped  them, charging  them 
with  its  luminous  glance.  After  its  fleet,  searching  pas- sage, things  looked  the same,  
but  weren't.

         I  dared  not  blink  or  breathe.  If  it  found  another awarenes s, it would  
destroy  it.

Every  night  before  it  got  to  me  it  gave  up.  It  hit my  wall’ s  corner  and  couldn't  
get  past.  It  shrank  com- pletely  into itself  and vanished.  I heard  the rising roar it
made  when  it  died  or  left.  I  still  couldn’ t  breathe.  I knew  that  it could return  
again  alive that same  night.

Sometime s  it  came  back,  sometime s   it  didn’ t. Most  often,  restless,  it  came  back.  
The  light  stripe slipped  in  the  door,  ran  searching  over  Amy’ s  wall,
stopped,  stretched  lunatic  at  the  first  corner,  raced wailing  toward  my  wall,  and  
vanished  into  the  second corner  with a cry. So I wouldn’t  go to bed.

It  was  a  passing  car  whose  windshield  reflected the corner streetlight  outside. I figured  
it out one night.

         Figuring  it  out  was  as  memorable  as  the  oblong itself.  Figuring  it  out  was 
 a  long  and  forced  ascent  to the very rim ot being, to  the membrane  of skin that both 
separates  and  connects  the  inner  life  and  the  outer world.  I climbed  deliberately  from  
the  depths  like  a
diver  who  releases  the  monster  in  his  arms  and  hauls

himself  hand over hand  up an  anchor chain  till  he meets the  ocean’ s  sparkling  membrane  
and  bursts  through  it; he  sights  the  sunlit,  becal med  hull  ot  his  boat,  which had  
bulked  so ominously  from below.

         I recognized  the noise it made  when  it left. That is, the  noise  it  made  called  
to  mind,  at  last,  my  daytime sensati ons  when  a  car  passed—the  sight  and  noise 
together.  A  car  came  roaring  down  hushed  Edgerton Avenue  in  front  of  our  house,  
stopped,  and  passed  on
shrieking  as  its  engine  shifted  up  the  gears.  What,  pre- cisely,  came  into  the  
bedroom?  A  reflection  from  the car's oblong  windshield.  Why did it travel in two parts? The 
window  sash split  the light and cast a shadow.
Night  after  night  I labored  up  the same  long  chain
of  reasoning,  as night after night  the thing  burst into the room  where I lay  awake.

There  was  a  world  outside  my  window  and  con- tiguous  to it. Why did  I have  to keep 
learning  this same thing over  and over? For I had learned  it a summer  ago,
when   men   with   jac khammer s   broke   up   Edgerton Avenue.  I had  watched  them from  
the  yard.  When  I lay to  nap,  I  listened.  One  restless  afternoon  I  connected the new 
noise in my bedroom  with  the jackhammer  men I  had  been  seeing  outside.  I  understood  
abruptly  that
these  worlds  met,  the outside  and the inside.  “Outside,” then,  was conceivably  just  
beyond  my  windows.

The  world  did  not  have  me in  mind.  It  was  a coin- cidental  collection  of  things  and  
people,  of  items,  and  I myself  was one such item—a child  walking  up the side-
walk,  whom  anyone  could  see  or  ignore.  The  things  in the  world  did  not  necessarily 
 cause  my  overwhelming feelings;  the feelings  were  inside  me,  beneath  my  skin, behind  my  
ribs,  within  my  skull.  They  were  even,  to some extent,  under  my control.

         I could  be connected  to  the outer  world  by  reason, if  I chose,  or I could  
yield  to  what amounted  to a narra- tive  fiction,  to  a  show  in  light  projected  on  the  
room’ s blue  walls.
