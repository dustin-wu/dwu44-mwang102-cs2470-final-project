Section 1: Reading Test
QUESTION 1
Choice B is the best answer. In the passage, a young man (Akira) asks
a mother (Chie) for permission to marry her daughter (Naomi). The
request was certainly surprising to the mother, as can be seen from
line 47, which states that prior to Akira‚Äôs question Chie ‚Äúhad no idea‚Äù
the request was coming.
Choice A is incorrect because the passage depicts two characters
engaged in a civil conversation, with Chie being impressed with
$NLUD≈ûV≈†VLQFHULW\≈°DQG∆ÆQGLQJKHUVHOI≈†VWDUWLQJWROLNHKLP≈°&KRLFH&
is incorrect because the passage is focused on the idea of Akira‚Äôs
and Naomi‚Äôs present lives and possible futures. Choice D is incorrect
because the interactions between Chie and Akira are polite, not critical;
for example, Chie views Akira with ‚Äúamusement,‚Äù not animosity.

QUESTION 2
Choice B is the best answer. The passage centers on a night when
a young man tries to get approval to marry a woman‚Äôs daughter. The
passage includes detailed descriptions of setting (a ‚Äúwinter‚Äôs eve‚Äù and

silent. She stood a full half minute looking straight into Chie‚Äôs eyes.
Finally, she spoke,‚Äù lines 88-89).
Choice A is incorrect because the passage focuses on a nontraditional
marriage proposal. Choice C is incorrect because the passage
concludes without resolution to the question of whether Akira and
Naomi will receive permission to marry. Choice D is incorrect because
the passage repeatedly makes clear that for Chie, her encounter with
Akira is momentous and unsettling, as when Akira acknowledges in

QUESTION 3
Choice C is the best answer. Akira ‚Äúcame directly, breaking all
tradition,‚Äù (line 1) when he approached Chie and asked to marry her
daughter, and he ‚Äúask[ed] directly,‚Äù without ‚Äúa go-between‚Äù (line 65) or
‚Äúmediation,‚Äù because doing otherwise would have taken too much time.
Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because in these contexts, ‚Äúdirectly‚Äù

when Akira says to Chie ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt judge my candidacy by the
unseemliness of this proposal.‚Äù
Choice B is incorrect because there is no evidence in the passage that
Akira worries that Chie will mistake his earnestness for immaturity.
Choice C is incorrect because while Akira recognizes that his
unscheduled visit is a nuisance, his larger concern is that Chie will
reject him due to the inappropriateness of his proposal. Choice D
is incorrect because there is no evidence in the passage that Akira
worries Chie will underestimate the sincerity of his emotions.

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this

because lines 71-72 indicate only that Akira was speaking in an eager
and forthright matter.

QUESTION 6
Choice D is the best answer because Akira clearly treats Chie with
respect, including ‚Äúbow[ing]‚Äù (line 26) to her, calling her ‚ÄúMadame‚Äù

how Akira approached Chie to ask for her daughter‚Äôs hand in marriage.
In these lines, the narrator is wondering whether Chie would have
been more likely to say yes to Akira‚Äôs proposal if Akira had followed
tradition: ‚ÄúAkira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had
he followed form ‚Äî had he asked his mother to speak to his father

a criticism of Akira‚Äôs individual marriage proposal but not the entire
tradition of Japanese marriage proposals. Choice C is incorrect
because the narrator does not question a suggestion.

QUESTION 8
Choice B is the best answer. In line 1, the narrator suggests that
Akira‚Äôs direct approach broke ‚Äúall tradition.‚Äù The narrator then
wonders if Akira had ‚Äúfollowed form,‚Äù or the tradition expected of him,
would Chie have been more receptive to his proposal. In this context,
following ‚Äúform‚Äù thus means following a certain tradition or custom.
Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because in this context ‚Äúform‚Äù does
not mean the way something looks (appearance), the way it is built
(structure), or its essence (nature).

QUESTION 9
Choice C is the best answer. Akira states that his unexpected meeting
with Chie occurred only because of a ‚Äúmatter of urgency,‚Äù which he
explains as ‚Äúan opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle‚Äôs
Japanese community‚Äù (lines 41-42). Akira decides to directly speak to

Choice D is incorrect; while Akira may know that Chie is unaware
of his feelings for Naomi, this is not what he is referring to when he
mentions ‚Äúa matter of urgency.‚Äù

QUESTION 10
Choice B is the best answer.,QOLQHV$NLUDFODUL∆ÆHVWKDWWKH≈†PDWWHU
of urgency‚Äù is that he has ‚Äúan opportunity to go to America, as dentist for
Seattle‚Äôs Japanese community.‚Äù Akira needs Chie‚Äôs answer to his marriage
proposal so he can decide whether to accept the job in Seattle.

Choices A, C, and D do not provide the best evidence for the answer to
WKHSUHYLRXVTXHVWLRQ&KRLFH$LVLQFRUUHFWEHFDXVHLQOLQH$NLUD

proposal has ‚Äústartled‚Äù Chie and does not explain why his request is
time-sensitive.

QUESTION 11
Choice A is the best answer. Lines 1-9 include examples of how many
people shop (‚Äúmillions of shoppers‚Äù), how much money they spend
≈†RYHUELOOLRQDWUHWDLOVWRUHVLQWKHPRQWKRI'HFHPEHUDORQH≈° 
and the many occasions that lead to shopping for gifts (‚Äúincluding
weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, and baby showers.‚Äù).
Combined, these examples show how frequently people in the US shop
for gifts.
Choice B is incorrect because even though the authors mention that
≈†ELOOLRQ≈°KDGEHHQVSHQWLQUHWDLOVWRUHVLQRQHPRQWKWKDW∆ÆJXUH
is never discussed as an increase (or a decrease). Choice C is incorrect
because lines 1-9 provide a context for the amount of shopping that
occurs in the US, but the anxiety (or ‚Äúdread‚Äù) it might cause is not
introduced until later in the passage. Choice D is incorrect because
OLQHVGRPRUHWKDQKLJKOLJKWWKHQXPEHURIGL∆¨HUHQWRFFDVLRQVWKDW
lead to gift-giving.

QUESTION 12

Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because in this context, ‚Äúambivalent‚Äù
does not mean feelings that are unrealistic, apprehensive, or supportive.

Choice A is incorrect because even though the authors state that some
VKRSSHUVPDNHWKHLUFKRLFHVEDVHGRQ≈†HJRFHQWULVP≈° OLQH WKHUH
is no evidence in the passage that people view shopping as a form of
self-expression. Choice B is incorrect because the passage implies
that shopping is an expensive habit. Choice C is incorrect because the
passage states that most people have purchased and received gifts,
but it never implies that people are UHTXLUHG to reciprocate the
gift-giving process.

givers often fail to consider the recipients‚Äô preferences. Choice D is
incorrect because lines 44-47 suggest that the cost of a gift may not
correlate to a recipient‚Äôs appreciation of it.

E\LWRU∆ÆQGLWVXUSULVLQJRUXQSUHFHGHQWHG

QUESTION 16
Choice C is the best answer. Lines 41-44 suggest that gift-givers
assume a correlation between the cost of a gift and how well-received
it will be: ‚Äú. . . gift-givers equate how much they spend with how
much recipients will appreciate the gift (the more expensive the gift,
the stronger a gift-recipient‚Äôs feelings of appreciation).‚Äù However, the
authors suggest this assumption may be incorrect or ‚Äúunfounded‚Äù
(line 47), as gift-recipients ‚Äúmay not construe smaller and larger gifts
as representing smaller and larger signals of thoughtfulness and

Choices A, B, and D are all incorrect because the passage neither
states nor implies that the gift-givers‚Äô assumption is insincere,
unreasonable, or substantiated.

QUESTION 17
Choice C is the best answer./LQHVVXJJHVWWKDWWKHDVVXPSWLRQ
made by gift-givers in lines 41-44 may be incorrect. The gift-givers
assume that recipients will have a greater appreciation for costly gifts

be incorrect, as gift-recipients ‚Äúmay not construe smaller and larger
gifts as representing smaller and larger signals of thoughtfulness and

QUESTION 18
Choice D is the best answer./LQHVVWDWHWKDW≈†3HUKDSVJLYHUV
believe that bigger (i.e., more expensive) gifts convey stronger signals
of thoughtfulness and consideration.‚Äù In this context, saying that more
expensive gifts ‚Äúconvey‚Äù stronger signals means the gifts send, or
communicate, stronger signals to the recipients.
Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because in this context, to ‚Äúconvey‚Äù
something does not mean to transport it (physically move something),
counteract it (act in opposition to something), or exchange it (trade one
thing for another).

QUESTION 19
Choice A is the best answer. The paragraph examines how gift-givers
believe expensive gifts are more thoughtful than less expensive gifts
and will be more valued by recipients. The work of Camerer and
RWKHUVR∆¨HUVDQH[SODQDWLRQIRUWKHJLIWJLYHUV≈ûUHDVRQLQJ≈†JLIWJLYHUV
attempt to signal their positive attitudes toward the intended recipient
and their willingness to invest resources in a future relationship‚Äù
OLQHV 
Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the theory articulated
by Camerer and others is used to explain an idea put forward by
the authors (‚Äúgivers believe that bigger . . . gifts convey stronger
signals‚Äù), not to introduce an argument, question a motive, or support
a conclusion.

QUESTION 20
Choice B is the best answer. The graph clearly shows that gift-givers
believe that a ‚Äúmore valuable‚Äù gift will be more appreciated than
a ‚Äúless valuable gift.‚Äù According to the graph, gift-givers believe
the monetary value of a gift will determine whether that gift is well
received or not.
Choice A is incorrect because the graph does not suggest that giftgivers are aware of gift-recipients‚Äô appreciation levels. Choices C and
D are incorrect because neither the gift-givers‚Äô desire for the gifts they
purchase nor the gift-givers‚Äô relationship with the gift-recipients is
addressed in the graph.

$16:(5(;3/$1$7,216Ãù_Ãù6$73UDFWLFH7HVW

QUESTION 21
Choice A is the best answer. Lines 69-75 explain that while people
are often both gift-givers and gift-receivers, they struggle to apply
information they learned as a gift-giver to a time when they were a giftreceiver: ‚ÄúYet, despite the extensive experience that people have as both
givers and receivers, they often struggle to transfer information gained
from one role (e.g., as a giver) and apply it in another, complementary
role (e.g., as a receiver).‚Äù The authors suggest that the disconnect
between how much appreciation a gift-giver thinks a gift merits and how
much appreciation a gift-recipient displays for the gift may be caused by
both individuals‚Äô inability to comprehend the other‚Äôs perspective.
Choices B and C are incorrect because neither the passage nor the
graph addresses the idea that society has become more materialistic or
that there is a growing opposition to gift-giving. Choice D is incorrect
because the passage emphasizes that gift-givers and gift-recipients
IDLOWRXQGHUVWDQGHDFKRWKHU≈ûVSHUVSHFWLYHEXWLWR∆¨HUVQRHYLGHQFH
that the disconnect results only from a failure to understand the
other‚Äôs intentions.

QUESTION 22
Choice B is the best answer. Lines 2-4 of the passage describe DNA
as ‚Äúa very long chain, the backbone of which consists of a regular
alternation of sugar and phosphate groups.‚Äù The backbone of DNA,
in other words, is the main structure of a chain made up of repeating
units of sugar and phosphate.
Choice A is incorrect because the passage describes DNA on the
molecular level only and never mentions the spinal column of
organisms. Choice C is incorrect because the passage describes the
backbone of the molecule as having ‚Äúa regular alternation‚Äù of sugar
and phosphate, not one or the other. Choice D is incorrect because the
nitrogenous bases are not the main structural unit of DNA; rather, they
are attached only to the repeating units of sugar.

QUESTION 23
Choice D is the best answer. The authors explain that hydrogen bonds
join together pairs of nitrogenous bases, and that these bases have a
VSHFL∆ÆFVWUXFWXUHWKDWOHDGVWRWKHSDLULQJ≈†2QHPHPEHURIDSDLUPXVW

Choice A is incorrect because lines 5-6 describe how nitrogenous
bases attach to sugar but not how those bases pair with one another.

feature of our structure which is of biological interest is that it consists

Choices A and B are incorrect because lines 12-14 explicitly state that
it is the two chains of DNA that are of ‚Äúbiological interest,‚Äù not the
FKHPLFDOIRUPXODRI'1$QRUWKHFRPPRQ∆ÆEHUD[LVWKRVHWZRFKDLQV
are wrapped around. Choice C is incorrect because, while the X-ray
evidence did help Watson and Crick to discover that DNA consists of
two chains, it was not claimed to be the feature of biological interest.

QUESTION 25
Choice C is the best answer. In lines 12-14 the authors claim that
DNA molecules appear to be comprised of two chains, even though
‚Äúit has often been assumed . . . there would be only one‚Äù (lines 15-17).
The authors support this claim with evidence compiled from an X-ray:
‚Äúthe density, taken with the X-ray evidence, suggests very strongly that
there are two [chains]‚Äù (lines 18-19).
Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because the authors mention
density and X-ray evidence to support a claim, not to establish that
DNA carries genetic information, present a hypothesis about the
FRPSRVLWLRQRIDQXFOHRWLGHRUFRQ∆ÆUPDUHODWLRQVKLSEHWZHHQWKH
density and chemical formula of DNA.

QUESTION 26
Choice B is the best answer. The authors explain that ‚Äúonly certain pairs
RIEDVHVZLOO∆ÆWLQWRWKHVWUXFWXUH≈° OLQHV RIWKH'1$PROHFXOH
These pairs must contain ‚Äúa purine and the other a pyrimidine in order

RWKHUSDLULQJZRXOGQRW≈†∆ÆWLQWRWKHVWUXFWXUH≈°RIWKH'1$PROHFXOH
Therefore, a pair of purines would be larger than the required purine/
S\ULPLGLQHSDLUDQGZRXOGQRW∆ÆWLQWRWKHVWUXFWXUHRIWKH'1$PROHFXOH
Choice A is incorrect because this section is not discussing the
distance between a sugar and phosphate group. Choice C is incorrect
because the passage never makes clear the size of the pyrimidines or
purines in relation to each other, only in relation to the space needed to
bond the chains of the DNA molecule. Choice D is incorrect because the
lines do not make an implication about the size of a pair of pyrimidines
in relation to the size of a pair consisting of a purine and a pyrimidine.

QUESTION 27
Choice D is the best answer. The authors explain how the DNA
PROHFXOHFRQWDLQVD≈†SUHFLVHVHTXHQFHRIEDVHV≈° OLQHV DQGWKDW
the authors can use the order of bases on one chain to determine the
order of bases on the other chain: ‚ÄúIf the actual order of the bases on

Thus one chain is, as it were, the complement of the other, and it is
this feature which suggests how the deoxyribonucleic acid molecule
might duplicate itself‚Äù (lines 45-51). The authors use the words
≈†H[DFW≈°≈†VSHFL∆ÆF≈°DQG≈†FRPSOHPHQW≈°LQWKHVHOLQHVWRVXJJHVWWKDWWKH
base pairings along a DNA chain is understood and predictable, and
may explain how DNA ‚Äúduplicate[s] itself‚Äù (line 51).
Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that most
nucleotide sequences are known. Choice B is incorrect because these
lines are not discussing the random nature of the base sequence
along one chain of DNA. Choice C is incorrect because the authors
are describing the bases attached only to the sugar, not to the sugarphosphate backbone.

QUESTION 28
Choice C is the best answer. Lines 6-7 state that ‚ÄúTwo of the possible
bases ‚Äî adenine and guanine ‚Äî are purines,‚Äù and on the table the

Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not state the
percentages of both purines, adenine and guanine, in yeast DNA.

QUESTION 29
Choice A is the best answer. The authors state: ‚ÄúWe believe that the
bases will be present almost entirely in their most probable forms.
If this is true, the conditions for forming hydrogen bonds are more
restrictive, and the only pairs of bases possible are: adenine with
WK\PLQHDQGJXDQLQHZLWKF\WRVLQH≈° OLQHV 7KHWDEOHVKRZV

Choice B is incorrect. Although the choice of ‚ÄúYes‚Äù is correct, the
explanation for that choice misrepresents the data in the table. Choices C

Choices B, C, and D do not provide the best evidence for the answer

QUESTION 32
Choice B is the best answer. In this passage, Woolf asks women
a series of questions. Woolf wants women to consider joining ‚Äúthe
procession of educated men‚Äù (lines 56-57) by becoming members
of the workforce. Woolf stresses that this issue is urgent, as
women ‚Äúhave very little time in which to answer [these questions]‚Äù
(lines 48-49).
Choice A is incorrect because Woolf argues against the tradition of

Choice C is incorrect because Woolf is not highlighting the severity
of social divisions as much as she is explaining how those divisions
might be reduced (with women joining the workforce). Choice D is
incorrect because Woolf does not question the feasibility of changing
the workforce dynamic.

QUESTION 33
Choice A is the best answer. Throughout the passage, Woolf
advocates for more women to engage with existing institutions by
joining the workforce: ‚ÄúWe too can leave the house, can mount those

they are at a ‚Äúmoment of transition‚Äù (line 51) where they must consider
their future role in the workforce.
Choice B is incorrect because even though Woolf mentions women‚Äôs
traditional roles (lines 68-69: ‚Äúwhile they stirred the pot, while they
rocked the cradle‚Äù), she does not suggest that women will have to
give up these traditional roles to gain positions of influence. Choice C
is incorrect because though Woolf wonders how ‚Äúthe procession
of the sons of educated men‚Äù impacts women‚Äôs roles, she does not
argue that this male-dominated society has had grave and continuing
effects. Choice D is incorrect because while Woolf suggests educated
women can hold positions currently held by men, she does not
suggest that women‚Äôs entry into positions of power will change
those positions.

Choice C is the best answer. Woolf uses the word ‚Äúwe‚Äù to refer
to herself and educated women in English society, the ‚Äúdaughters

whether people in a group are friendly to one another; she is concerned
with generating solidarity among women. Choice B is incorrect
because though Woolf admits women have predominantly ‚Äúdone their
thinking‚Äù within traditional female roles (lines 64-69), she does not use
‚Äúwe‚Äù to advocate for more candor among women. Choice D is incorrect
because Woolf does not use ‚Äúwe‚Äù to emphasize a need for people in a
group to respect one other; rather, she wants to establish a sense of
solidarity among women.

Choice A is incorrect because while Woolf states the bridge ‚Äúis a place to

consider the facts‚Äù (lines 6-9). Woolf is not using the bridge for fanciful

suggest that the bridge is a symbol of a male-dominated past, but rather
that it serves as a good place to watch men proceed to work.

QUESTION 36
Choice D is the best answer. Woolf writes that the men who conduct

Choice A is incorrect because the procession is described as ‚Äúa

always been influential. Choice B is incorrect because the passage

women are joining the male-dominated procession that travels to and
from the work place: ‚ÄúFor there, trapesing along at the tail end of the
procession, we go ourselves.‚Äù
Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not provide the
best evidence for the answer to the previous question. Choice A is
incorrect because lines 12-17 describe the positions predominantly
held by men. Choice B is incorrect because lines 17-19 use a
metaphor to describe how the procession physically looks.

Choice A is incorrect because Woolf characterizes the questions as
urgent and important, not as something that would cause controversy
or fear. Choice B is incorrect because though Woolf considers the
questions to be weighty (or ‚Äúimportant‚Äù), she implies that they can be
answered. Choice D is incorrect because Woolf does not imply that the
questions are mysterious.

Choice B is the best answer. The answer to the previous question

questions as ‚Äúimportant,‚Äù or momentous, and states that women
‚Äúhave very little time in which to answer them,‚Äù which shows their
urgency.
Choices A, C, and D do not provide the best evidence for the answer
to the previous question. Choices A and D are incorrect because

Choice C is the best answer. Woolf writes that women ‚Äúhave
thought‚Äù while performing traditional roles such as cooking and

‚Äúsixpence‚Äù mentioned in these lines is not a literal coin. Woolf is
using the ‚Äúsixpence‚Äù as a metaphor, as she is suggesting women
take advantage of the opportunity to join the male-dominated
workforce.
Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because in this context, ‚Äúsixpence‚Äù
does not refer to tolerance, knowledge, or perspective.

48(67,21
Choice B is the best answer. In lines 72-76, Woolf repeats the
phrase ‚Äúlet us think‚Äù to emphasize how important it is for women to
critically reflect on their role in society. Woolf states this reflection
can occur at any time: ‚ÄúLet us think in offices; in omnibuses;
while we are standing in the crowd watching Coronations and
Lord Mayor‚Äôs Shows; let us think . . . in the gallery of the House of
Commons; in the Law Courts; let us think at baptisms and marriages
and funerals.‚Äù
Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because in lines 72-76 Woolf is
not emphasizing the novelty of the challenge faced by women, the
complexity of social and political issues, or the enjoyable aspect of
women‚Äôs career possibilities.

earthly demands for precious metals, such as platinum and gold, and
the rare earth elements vital for personal electronics, such as yttrium

Choice B is incorrect because Passage 1 does not suggest that precious
metals extracted from space may make metals more valuable on
Earth. Choice C and Choice D are incorrect because Passage 1 never
mentions how space mining could create unanticipated technological
innovations or change scientists‚Äô understanding of space resources.

Choice A is the best answer. Lines 18-22 suggest that space mining
may help meet ‚Äúearthly demands for precious metals . . . and the rare
earth elements vital for personal electronics.‚Äù In this statement, the
author is stating materials (‚Äúmetals,‚Äù ‚Äúearth elements‚Äù) that may be
gathered as a result of space mining, and that these materials may be
important to Earth‚Äôs economy.

correct plural form of ‚Äúwaterway,‚Äù conveys the idea that acid whey could
impact multiple bodies of water. Additionally, the compound verb ‚Äúcan

shift in verb tense. The present tense verb ‚Äúcan pollute‚Äù should be used
instead, as it is consistent with the other verbs in the paragraph.

outweigh the potential drawbacks of its production.‚Äù
Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they inaccurately describe
the sentence in question.

QUESTION 7
Choice B is the best answer because it provides a grammatically
standard preposition that connects the verb ‚Äúserves‚Äù and noun
‚Äúdigestive aid‚Äù and accurately depicts their relationship.
&KRLFH$LVLQFRUUHFWEHFDXVHWKHLQ∆ÆQLWLYHIRUP≈†WREH≈°\LHOGVD
grammatically incorrect verb construction: ‚Äúserves to be.‚Äù Choices C
and D are incorrect because both present options that deviate from
standard English usage.

QUESTION 8
Choice C is the best answer because it presents a verb tense that is
consistent in the context of the sentence. The choice is also free of the
redundant ‚Äúit.‚Äù
Choice A is incorrect because the subject ‚Äúit‚Äù creates a redundancy.
Choices B and D are incorrect because they present verb tenses that
are inconsistent in the context of the sentence.

QUESTION 9

QUESTION 11
Choice B is the best answer because it provides a syntactically
coherent and grammatically correct sentence.
Choices A and C are incorrect because the adverbial conjunctions
‚Äútherefore‚Äù and ‚Äúso,‚Äù respectively, are unnecessary following
‚ÄúBecause.‚Äù Choice D is incorrect because it results in a grammatically
incomplete sentence (the part of the sentence before the colon must be
an independent clause).

QUESTION 12
Choice B is the best answer because the graph clearly indicates that, on
March 5, average low temperatures are at their lowest point: 12 degrees
Fahrenheit.
Choice A is incorrect because the phrase ‚Äúas low as‚Äù suggests that
WKHWHPSHUDWXUHIDOOVQRORZHUWKDQGHJUHHV)DKUHQKHLWEXWWKH
chart shows that in January, February, and March, the temperature
frequently falls below that point. Choices C and D are incorrect
because the information each provides is inconsistent with the
information on the chart.

QUESTION 13
Choice A is the best answer because it concisely combines the two
sentences while maintaining the original meaning.
Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because each is unnecessarily wordy,
thus undermining one purpose of combining two sentences: to make
the phrasing more concise.

48(67,21
Choice B is the best answer because it provides a conjunctive adverb
that accurately represents the relationship between the two sentences.
‚ÄúHowever‚Äù signals an exception to a case stated in the preceding sentence.
Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because each provides a transition
that does not accurately represent the relationship between the two
sentences, and as a result each compromises the logical coherence of
these sentences.

QUESTION 15
Choice C is the best answerEHFDXVHLWSURYLGHVFRPPDVWRR∆¨VHWWKH
nonrestrictive modifying clause ‚Äúan associate professor of geology at
2KLR6WDWH≈°

Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because each provides punctuation
that does not adequately separate the nonrestrictive modifying clause
about Jason Box from the main clause.

QUESTION 16
Choice C is the best answer because the colon signals that the other
factor that contributed to the early thaw is about to be provided.
Choice A is incorrect because it results in a sentence that deviates
from grammatical standards: a semicolon should be used to separate
two independent clauses, but in choice A the second clause only has
a subject, not a verb. Choice B is incorrect because it is unnecessarily
wordy. Choice D is incorrect because ‚Äúbeing‚Äù is unnecessary and
creates an incoherent clause.

QUESTION 17
Choice C is the best answer because it provides the correct
preposition (‚Äúof‚Äù) and relative pronoun (‚Äúwhich‚Äù) that together create a
dependent clause following the comma.
Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because each results in a comma
splice. Two independent clauses cannot be joined with only a comma.

QUESTION 18
Choice A is the best answer because the verb tense is consistent with
WKHSUHFHGLQJSDVWWHQVHYHUEVLQWKHVHQWHQFHVSHFL∆ÆFDOO\≈†SURGXFHG≈°
and ‚Äúdrifted.‚Äù
Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because each utilizes a verb tense
that is not consistent with the preceding past tense verbs in the
sentence.

QUESTION 19
Choice D is the best answer because ‚Äútheir‚Äù is the possessive form of
a plural noun. In this case, the noun is plural: ‚Äúsnow and ice.‚Äù
Choices A and B are incorrect because the possessive pronoun must
refer to a plural noun, ‚Äúsnow and ice,‚Äù rather than a singular noun.
Choice C is incorrect because ‚Äúthere‚Äù would result in an incoherent
sentence.

QUESTION 20
Choice D is the best answer. The preceding sentences in the paragraph
have established that a darker surface of soot-covered snow leads to
more melting because this darker surface absorbs heat, whereas a

that the preceding sentences already imply.

$16:(5(;3/$1$7,216Ãù_Ãù6$73UDFWLFH7HVW

Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the information each
provides fails to support the previous claim that the ‚Äúresult‚Äù of the soot
‚Äúis a self-reinforcing cycle.‚Äù

QUESTION 21
Choice B is the best answer because it is free of redundancies.
Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because each of the three presents
a redundancy: Choice A uses ‚Äúrepeat‚Äù and ‚Äúagain‚Äù; Choice C uses
≈†GDPDJH≈°DQG≈†KDUPIXOH∆¨HFWV≈°DQG&KRLFH'XVHV≈†PD\≈°DQG
‚Äúpossibly.‚Äù

QUESTION 22
Choice D is the best answer because sentence 5 describes the
information Box seeks: ‚Äúto determine just how much the soot is
contributing to the melting of the ice sheet.‚Äù Unless sentence 4 comes
after sentence 5, readers will not know what the phrase ‚Äúthis crucial
information‚Äù in sentence 4 refers to.
Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because each results in an illogical
sentence progression. None of the sentences that would precede
sentence 4 provides details that could be referred to as ‚Äúthis crucial
information.‚Äù

QUESTION 23
Choice D is the best answer because it is free of redundancies and
R∆¨HUVWKHFRUUHFWIRUPRIWKHYHUE≈†ZHDU≈°LQWKLVFRQWH[W

choice A‚Äôs ‚Äúsoon‚Äù and choice B and C‚Äôs ‚Äúpromptly‚Äù all result in
redundancies. Choices A and B are also incorrect because each uses
an incorrect form of the verb.

48(67,21
Choice D is the best answer because it is the only choice that
provides a grammatically standard and coherent sentence. The
participial phrase ‚ÄúHaving become frustrated. . .‚Äù functions as an
adjective modifying ‚ÄúI,‚Äù the writer.
Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because each results in a dangling

choice C‚Äôs ‚Äúideas.‚Äù As such, all three choices yield incoherent and
grammatically incorrect sentences.

QUESTION 25
Choice B is the best answer because it provides the correct
preposition in this context, ‚Äúabout.‚Äù

Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because each provides a preposition
WKDWGHYLDWHVIURPFRUUHFWXVDJH2QHPLJKWUHDGDQDUWLFOH≈†DERXW≈°
coworking spaces but not an article ‚Äúinto,‚Äù ‚Äúupon,‚Äù or ‚Äúfor‚Äù coworking
spaces.

QUESTION 26
Choice A is the best answer because it provides the correct punctuation
for the dependent clause that begins with the phrase ‚Äúsuch as.‚Äù
Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because each presents punctuation
that deviates from the standard way of punctuating the phrase ‚Äúsuch as.‚Äù
When ‚Äúsuch as‚Äù is a part of a nonrestrictive clause, as it is here, only
one comma is needed to separate it from the main independent clause.

QUESTION 27
Choice B is the best answer because it provides a transitional phrase,
‚ÄúIn addition to equipment,‚Äù that accurately represents the relationship
between the two sentences connected by the transitional phrase.
Together, the sentences describe the key features of coworking spaces,
IRFXVLQJRQZKDWWKHVSDFHVR∆¨HU HTXLSPHQWDQGPHHWLQJURRPV 
Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because each provides a transition
that does not accurately represent the relationship between the two
sentences.

QUESTION 28
Choice C is the best answer because the sentence is a distraction
from the paragraph‚Äôs focus. Nothing in the paragraph suggests that the
cost of setting up a coworking business is relevant here.
Choices A and D are incorrect because neither accurately represents
the information in the paragraph. Choice B is incorrect because it does
not accurately represent the information in the next paragraph.

QUESTION 29
Choice B is the best answer because it logically follows the writer‚Äôs
preceding statement about creativity and accurately represents the
information in the graph.
Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because they present inaccurate
and unsupported interpretations of the information in the graph. In
addition, none of these choices provides directly relevant support for
the main topic of the paragraph.

QUESTION 30
Choice D is the best answer because it provides a relative pronoun
and verb that create a standard and coherent sentence. The relative
pronoun ‚Äúwho‚Äù refers to the subject ‚Äúthe people,‚Äù and the plural verb
‚Äúuse‚Äù corresponds grammatically with the plural noun ‚Äúpeople.‚Äù

$16:(5(;3/$1$7,216Ãù_Ãù6$73UDFWLFH7HVW

Choices A and B are incorrect because ‚Äúwhom‚Äù is the relative pronoun
used to represent an object. The noun ‚Äúpeople‚Äù is a subject performing
an action (using the coworking space). Choices B and C are also
incorrect because they display a form of the verb ‚Äúto use‚Äù that does not
correspond to the plural noun ‚Äúpeople.‚Äù

QUESTION 31
Choice C is the best answerEHFDXVHWKHSURSRVHGVHQWHQFHR∆¨HUVD

Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because each would result in an
illogical progression of sentences.

QUESTION 32
Choice A is the best answer because the punctuation it provides
results in a grammatically standard and coherent sentence. When
an independent clause is followed by a list, a colon is used to link
the two.
Choice B is incorrect because the punctuation creates a fragment
(a semicolon should be used to link two independent clauses).
Choice C is incorrect because its use of the comma creates a series in
which ‚Äúseveral of my coworking colleagues‚Äù are distinguished from
the ‚Äúwebsite developer‚Äù and others, although the logic of the sentence
would suggest that they are the same. Choice D is incorrect because
it lacks the punctuation necessary to link the independent clause and
the list.

QUESTION 33
Choice A is the best answer because it provides a phrase that is
consistent with standard English usage and also maintains the tone
and style of the passage.
Choice B is incorrect because ‚Äúgive some wisdom‚Äù deviates from
standard English usage and presents a somewhat colloquial phrase
in a text that is generally free of colloquialisms. Choices C and D are
incorrect because both are inconsistent with the tone of the passage as
well as its purpose. The focus of the paragraph is on sharing, not on
proclaiming opinions.

sets up the information that follows, which is about colleges‚Äô failure to
support the study of philosophy.

QUESTION 38
Choice C is the best answer because it provides a transition that
logically connects the information in the previous sentence to the
information in this one. Both sentences provide evidence of colleges‚Äô
lack of support of philosophy programs, so the adverb ‚ÄúMoreover,‚Äù
which means ‚ÄúIn addition,‚Äù accurately captures the relationship
between the two sentences.
Choices A, B, and D are incorrect because each presents a transition
that does not accurately depict or support the relationship between
WKHWZRVHQWHQFHV7KHVHFRQGVHQWHQFHLVQRWDUHVXOWRIWKH∆ÆUVW
(‚ÄúTherefore,‚Äù ‚ÄúThus‚Äù), and the sentences do not provide a contrast

‚Äúresults,‚Äù so it is confusing to refer to ‚Äúthese results‚Äù and indicate that

way to express the idea is simply to say that some students ‚Äúoften
do better‚Äù than some other students ‚Äúin both verbal reasoning and

Choice B is the best answer because it provides subject-verb agreement
and thus creates a grammatically correct and coherent sentence.
Choice A is incorrect because the verb ‚Äúhas scored‚Äù does not
correspond with the plural subject ‚Äústudents.‚Äù Similarly, Choice C is
incorrect because the verb ‚Äúscores‚Äù would correspond with a singular
subject, but not the plural subject present in this sentence. Choice D
is incorrect because it results in a grammatically incomplete and
incoherent sentence.

48(67,21
Choice B is the best answer because it provides a coherent and
grammatically standard sentence.
Choices A and D are incorrect because both present ‚Äústudents‚Äù in the
possessive form, whereas the sentence establishes ‚Äústudents‚Äù as the
subject (‚Äúmany students . . . have‚Äù). Choice C is incorrect because the
verb form it proposes results in an incomplete and incoherent sentence.

Choices A and B are incorrect because the proposed sentence

incorrect because, as with Choice A, Plato‚Äôs works have nothing to do
with ‚Äúthe employability of philosophy majors.‚Äù

48(67,21
Choice D is the best answer because it creates a complete and

Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because each inserts an unnecessary

Choice D is the best answer because it provides a possessive pronoun

QUESTION 3
Choice C is correct. The total number of text messages sent by Armand
can be found by multiplying his rate of texting, in number of text
messages sent per hour, by the total number of hours he spent sending
them; that is P texts/hour √ó 5 hours = 5P texts. Similarly, the total number
of text messages sent by Tyrone is his hourly rate of texting multiplied
by the 4 hours he spent texting: S texts/hour √ó 4 hours = 4S texts. The
total number of text messages sent by Armand and Tyrone is the sum of
the total number of messages sent by Armand and the total number of
messages sent by Tyrone: 5P + 4S.
Choice A is incorrect and arises from adding the coefficients and
multiplying the variables of 5P and 4S. Choice B is incorrect and is
the result of multiplying 5P and 4S. The total number of messages
sent by Armand and Tyrone should be the sum of 5P and 4S, not the
product of these terms. Choice D is incorrect because it multiplies
Armand‚Äôs number of hours spent texting by Tyrone‚Äôs hourly rate of

$16:(5(;3/$1$7,216Ãù_Ãù6$73UDFWLFH7HVW

QUESTION 35
The correct answer is 6. The volume of a cylinder is ≈íU 2h, where
U is the radius of the base of the cylinder and h is the height of the
cylinder. Since the storage silo is a cylinder with volume 72≈í cubic
yards and height 8 yards, it follows that 72≈í = ≈íU 2(8), where U is the
radius of the base of the cylinder, in yards. Dividing both sides of the
equation 72≈í = ≈íU 2(8) by 8≈í gives U 2 = 9, and so the radius of the base
