Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has
given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a
land whose coast lines would enclose half the
countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between
the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater
England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people
that He has planted on this soil; a people sprung
from the most masterful blood of history; a people
perpetually revitalized by the virile . . . working-folk
of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their
power, by right of their institutions, by authority of
their heaven-directed purposes—the propagandists
and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history
our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a
history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a
history heroic with faith in our mission and our
future; a history of statesmen, who flung the
boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored
lands . . . a history of soldiers, who carried the flag
across blazing deserts and through the ranks of
hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a
history of a multiplying people, who overran a
continent in half a century . . . a history divinely
logical, in the process of whose tremendous
reasoning we find ourselves to-day. . . .
Think of the thousands of Americans who will
pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the
Republic’s laws cover those islands with justice and
safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans
who will invade . . . the Philippines when a liberal
government . . . shall establish order and equity
there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of
Americans who will build a . . . civilization of energy
and industry in Cuba, when a government of law
replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!—
think of the prosperous millions that Empress of
Islands will support when, obedient to the law of
political gravitation, her people ask for the highest
honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the
Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great
Republic!
If it is right for the United States to hold the
Philippine Islands permanently and imitate
European empires in the government of colonies, the
Republican party ought to state its position and
defend it, but it must expect the subject races to
protest against such a policy and to resist to the
extent of their ability.
The Filipinos do not need any encouragement
from Americans now living. Our whole history has
been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but
to all who are denied a voice in their own
government. If the Republicans are prepared to
censure all who have used language calculated to
make the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them
condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he
uttered that passionate appeal, “Give me liberty or
give me death,” he exprest a sentiment which still
echoes in the hearts of men.
Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of
history none have used words so offensive to those
who would hold their fellows in political bondage.
Let them censure Washington, who declared that the
colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.
Or, if the statute of limitations has run against
the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let
them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will
be quoted in defense of popular government when
the present advocates of force and conquest are
forgotten.
Some one has said that a truth once spoken can
never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can
set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it
were possible to obliterate every word written or
spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the
Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest
would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it
was God himself who placed in every human heart
the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so
low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it
would welcome a foreign master.
Those who would have this Nation enter upon a
career of empire must consider, not only the effect of
imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also
calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot
repudiate the principle of self-government in the
Philippines without weakening that principle here.
