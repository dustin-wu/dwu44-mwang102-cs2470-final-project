Acupuncture    and    other   forms   ot    traditi onaI Chinese   medicine   have  been  around  
for  more  than 4,000 years.  Yet  the explanation  for how  acupuncture— and Chinese  medicine  as 
a whole—works  has long  been
a mystery  for most  Western  doctors. The basic  theory  is outlined  in  a  text from  2
B.C.  It  recognizes  in  people and  in  nature  a  vital  energy  or  lite  torce  known  as  qi. 
Qi  is  the  source  of  movements  ranging  from  voluntary muscle  action  to  blood  tl ow;  it  
protects  the  body  from
external  influences,  and  it  generates  warmth.  Qi  flows through  the body  and  to the 
organs  by  way  ot  an  exten- sive system of channels known  as meridians. If  the flow of  the  
force  is  disturbed,  the  theory  goes,  the  resulting deficiency,  excess,  or  stagnation  of  
qi  causes  bodily
maltunction  and thus illness.
Acupuncture,  in  which  needles  are  inserted  into specific  points  along  the  meridians  and  
manipulated,  is said  to  restore  the  proper  tlow  ot  qi  and  thereby  return the   body   to 
  health.   Practitioners   recognize   some
1,5acupoints,  most  of  which  have  no  obvious  rela- tionship  to  their  intended  
targets.  For  example,  a  point on   the   second   toe   is   u sed   to   treat   headaches   
and toothache s,  while  a  point  near  the  elbow  enhances  the immune system.

         Another  integral  concept  is  the  tension  between two  ever-present,  
complementary  forces  of  nature,  yin and  yang.  When  their  balance  is  disturbed,  the  
theory goes,  people  get  sick.  Yin  conditions  reflect  a  lack  of qi:  pale  face,  cold  
extremities,  slow  pulse,  depression.
Yang  conditions  result  from  an  excess  of  qi:  red  face, fever, fast pulse, agitation.

Doctors   and   licensed   practitioners   administer between  9  and  1 2  million  acupuncture  
treatments  each year in the United States, commonly  for pain  control.

         According  to  neuroscientist  Bruce  Pomeranz,  of the  University  of  Toronto,  
numerous  studies  over  the past  years  have  shown  that  inserting  needles  into 
acupoints  stimulates  nerves  in  the  underlying  muscles. That  stimulation,  researchers  
believe,  sends  impulses
up  the  spinal  cord  to  a  relatively  primitive  part  of  the brain known  as the limbic 
system, as  well as to the mid- brain  and  the  pituitary  gland.  Somehow  this  signaling leads  
to  the  release  of  endorphins  and  monoamines, chemicals  that  block  pain  signals  in  the 
spinal  cord  and
the brain.

“The  endorphin  story  is  really  nailed  down,”  says Pomeranz.  “The  acupoints  that  have  
been  mapped  over thousands  of  years  are likely  the spots  where nerves  are concentrated.” 
But  the endorphin  story  “doesn't  explain
many  of  the other claims of  acupuncture,”  he continues. “There  have  been  a  number  of  
clinical  trials  showing that  acupuncture  is  extremely   u seful  for  the  nausea



caused  by  chemotherapy  and  early  pregnancy.  That's not the endorphin  system.”

         Nor  does  the  endorphin  story  explain  what  physi- cist Zang-Hee Cho found  when  
exploring  acupoints  that are  traditionally   used  to  treat  v ision  problem s.  The points  
are  not found  near  the eyes  but  on  the outside  ot the  foot,   running   from   the  little  
 toe   to   the   ankle.
Acupuncturi sts  hold  that  stimulation  of  these  points with  needles  will  affect  the  
eyes  via  the  sy stem  of meridians   rather   than   through   the   central   nervous system.
To  test  that  premi se,  Cho  strapped  student  volun-
teers  into  an  fMR I  (functi onal  magnetic   resonance imaging)   machine,   the   resu1ts  
 from   which   can   be viewed  as  col orful  brain  activation  maps.  Cho  first stimulated  
the eyes of  the volunteers  by flashing  a light in  front  of  them.  The  resulting  images,  as 
 expected,
showed  a  concentration  of  color—an  increase  in  activ- ity—in  the visual cortex,  the 
portion  of  the brain  that is known  to be involved  in eye function.  Then  Cho had an 
acupuncturist  stimulate  one  of  the  vision-related  acu- points.  In  one  person   after  
another,   the  very   s ame
region  of  the  brain  lit up on  the fMRI image.  The  mag- nitude of  brain  activity  seen 
on acupuncture  stimulation was  nearly  as  strong  as  that  elicited  by  the  flash  of light.  
To  eliminate  the  possibility  of  a  placebo  effect, Cho also stimulated  a nonacupoint,  in 
the big toe. There
was no response in the visual cortex.
Like  many  preliminar y  scientific  reports,  Cho’s study  raises  more  questions  than  it  
answers.  Still,  he has  demonstrated  new  functional  effects  of  acupunc- ture.  “Classically, 
  ac u puncture   was  the   ultimate  in
experimentation; people  collected  data for thousands  of years,”  says  Joie  Jones,  
professor  of  radiological  sci- ences  at  the  University   of  Cal if ornia  at  Irv ine  and 
coauthor   of   the   study.   “With   these   studies,   we’ ve demonstrated  that  for  at  least 
 some  acupuncture  points
[a connection]  goes through  the brain.”
