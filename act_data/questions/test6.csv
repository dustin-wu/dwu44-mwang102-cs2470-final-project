   The  narrator  of  the  passage  can  best  be  described  as  a swimmer  who primarily:,   recalls  the  swim  of  his  life  and  the  factors  that motivated  him during that swim.,"   remembers  the  events  that  inspired  him  to  partici- pate in a time trial at the Junior  
Nationals.","   contrasts  the  joy  of  winning  competitions  early  in the season  with  his later 
struggles  to succeed.","   chronicles  his  swimming  career,  from  childhood through  high school.",A,1
"  Which  of  the  following  events  mentioned  in  the  pas- sage happened first 
chronologically?",    The  narrator  stood  on  the  blocks  at  the  Sunday time trial his senior  year.,   The  narrator  leapt  out  over  the  diving  well  in  late September.,"   The  narrator  swam  the  500-yard  freestyle  in  the high school  regional  meet as a 
senior.",     The  narrator   heard   a  boy  from  a  rival  school cheering.,B,1
"  The  narrator  describes  the  natatorium  as  being  nearly empty  of spectators  the day of  
his race in order  to:","   illustrate that the perfect  racing conditions  the nar- rator had hoped for weren't likely  
to occur.","   demonstrate  that,  contrary  to  the  narrator's  expec- tations,  the meet was energetic.",   explain   why  the  narrator's  coach  paced   at  the sound of  the horn.,   identify  why  the  narrator  felt  a  rush  of  energy before  the race.,A,1
"  The  narrator  indicates  that  when  he  swam  the  1,000- yard   freestyle   in  the  time  
trials,   the  world,  for   a moment,  seemed  to:","    speed  up, blurring  past and present events.","   rush  past, forcing  him to reflect in retrospect.","   move  in  slow  motion,  as  did  everything  around him.","     slow down, allowing  him to reflect  in real time.",D,1
"  The  passage  indicates  that  during  the  narrator's  swim at the time trial, he understood  
for the first time that:",   his goals would  always be one step farther on.,   he had trained for this swim for over a year.,    the  swim  was  an  event  that  was  important  to  him alone.,   swimming  is  a  choice  between  the  now  and  the later.,C,1
"  Based  on  the  passage,  the  “end”  the  narrator  mentions in line 80 most likely  refers to 
his:",    final pursuit  of fitness.,   last chance to qualify for Junior Nationals.,   memory  of  his final  Friday  night practice.,     ultimate  realization  that  he  had  defeated  the  other competitors  in  the race.,B,1
  The narrator  of  the  passage  characterizes  the time  trial in Houston  as:,   one  long  sprint  in  which  swimmers  attempted  to improve their times.,   a meet advertised  as a way to qualify for the Junior Nationals.,"    a  regional  meet  that  featured  only  the  500-yard freestyle and 1,000-yard  freestyle.",   an  informal  swimming  event  put  together  at  the last minute.,D,1
"   The  statement “That's  where  you're  going,  now  hurry up”  (lines  35—36)  can  most  
directly  be  attributed  to the:","    cheering  boy,  as  he  verbally  criticizes  the  narra- tor's efforts.","   cheering  boy,  as  he  shouts  encouragement  to  the narrator.","   narrator,  as  he  speculates  about  what  the  cheering boy meant when  the boy  pointed  at 
the pool.","     narrator,  as  he  angrily  contemplates  his  response to the cheering  boy.",C,1
"   For  the  narrator,  compared  to  practicing  in  the outdoor pool, practicing  in  the 
indoor  pool is:",   more  productive.,    more liberating.,   less appealing.,   less competitive.,C,1
"  When  the  narrator  heard  “Jump!”  in  his  mind  while swimming  (line 67), he was most 
likely  remembering:",    his   teammate’s   command   the  day   the  narrator caught the flag line.,   his  own  shout  as  he  leapt  off  the  outdoor  pool’s deck that fall.,   the cheers of  the boy from  the rival  school.,     the abrupt  start of  his race that Sunday.,A,1
"  The  author's  use  of  the  words  and  phrases  “thickets,” “stretching  in  every  
direction,”  and  “extensive  forest” (lines  6-7)  in Passage  A  most  nearly  serves  to  empha- 
size which of  the following  points?",   The   Tian   Shan   mountains   are   a   challenge   to navigate.,   The  apple  varieties  of  Kazakhstan  would  be  diffi- cult for a botanist to catalog.,   The  diversity  of  plant  species  in  Kazakhstan  is crucially  important.,   The  magnitude  of  wild  apples  in  Kazakhstan  is stunning.,D,2
"  The  author  of  Pass age  A  most  likely  states  that  the wild  apples  growing  in  the  
Tian  Shan  looked  like apples  found  at  the  local  grocery  store  to  support  the point 
that:",    many  of  the  apples  stocked  in  grocery  stores  are harvested in the Tian Shan.,"   in  the Tian Shan, Vavilov had likely found the wild ancestors  of  the domesticated  apple.","   the  wild  apples  growing   in  the  Tian  Shan  are among  the most popular  varieties  with 
consumers.","     in  the  Tian  Shan,  Vavilov  had  found  new  apple varieties to introduce to food 
producers.
13.  Passage A  makes  which  of  the  following  claims  about plant species  that are found in  
Kazakhstan?
A.   Approximately  157 species  of  cultivated  temperate fruits originated  in Kazakhstan.
B.    Ninety  percent  of  all domesticated  crops  are either direct  precursors  or  close  wild  
relatives  of  plant species found in Kazakhstan.
C.    Ol  the  plant  species  found  in  Kazakhstan,  ninety percent  are species of  apples.
D.   Aside from apples, at least 157 plant species found in  Kazakhstan  are either  direct  
precursors  or close wild relatives of  domesticated  crops.",B,2
"  Passage  B  most  strongly  suggests  that  Vavilov  was motivated  to become  an  
agricultural  scientist  primarily because  he:",    wanted  to have one of his findings  published.,   aimed to work  with a famous  botanist.,   wished  to remedy  a personal  financial  crisis.,     hoped to help feed others.,D,2
"  The  author   of   Passage  B   uses  the   phrase   “whittle away”  (line 80)  to  refer  to  
the  way  that  apple  varieties have been:","   gradually   lost  from   nursery  catalogs,  farmers' markets,  and the American  table.","   modified  by  plant  breeders,  entomolo g ists,  and pathologists  to meet specialized  
needs.","    weeded  out  by  scientists  until  only  the  few  thou- sand  most resilient  varieties 
remained.",   pared  down  in  1904  to the  few  varieties  that  nurs- ery catalogs  wanted  to feature.,D,2
"  As it is used in lines 82-83, the phrase named  and  nur- tured  most nearly  means:",    nominated  and encouraged.,   identified  and cultivated.,   pointed  to and groomed.,     cited  and fed.,A,2
"   In  Passage B,  it  can  most  reasonably  be  inferred  from the  third  paragraph  (lines  
74-79)  that  “centers  of  crop diversity”  become crucially  important  when:",   plant  breeders  would  like  to  learn  more  about  the plant species of central  Asia.,"    problems  with  a  cultivated  crop  require  experts  to research  a new variety  of  the 
crop.",   consumers  would  like more  variety  in grocery  pro- duce departments.,"   disputes  among  plant  breeders,  pathologists,  and entomologists  lead to a reduction  in 
crop variety.",B,2
"  Which  of  the  following  statements  best  describes  the difference in the tone of  the two 
passages?","    Passage  A   is   defensive,   whereas   Passage  B   is dispassionate.","   Passage  A   is    solemn,    whereas    Passage  B   is optimistic.","   Passage  A  is  celebratory,   whereas  Passage  B  is cautionary.","     Passage  A  is  accusatory,   whereas  Passage  B  is sentimental.",B,2
"  Compared  to  the  author  of  Passage  A,  the  author  of Passage B provides more 
information  about the:",   reduction  in the number  of  apple varieties  in North America over the past four centuries.,"   methods  Vavilov  used  to  prove  to  other  scientists that  the  apples  growing  in  the  
Tian  Shan  are  the ancestors  of  the modern  apple.",    number   of   apple   varieties   that   are  thriving   in Kazakhstan  today.,"   techniques  used  by  researchers  to  determine  the regions   with   the   greatest   
genetic   diversity   in plants.",C,2
"  Passage A quotes  Vavilov  as  saying  “‘I  could  see  with my  own  eyes  that  I  had  
stumbled  upon  the  centre  of origin  for  the  apple”’  (lines  l 1—12).  In  Passage B  this 
quote is directly:","    invoked  by  the passage  author  as he imagines  what Kazakhstan  looked  like centuries 
ago.",   used  to support  an argument  by  USDA scientists.,   paraphrased  by Salova.,     refuted  by Bussey.,A,2
"  Based  on  the  passage,  how  did  Berry's  personality affect his career?","   His  ambitious,  competitive  personality  was  off- putting  to  other  musicians,  who  were 
 reluctant  to play  with him.","   His genial personality  endeared  him to other  musi- cians,  but  his  career  suffered  when 
 he  spent  more time socializing  than practicing.","   His  modest  and  eas ygoing  personality  kept  him out of  the spotlight  and, consequently, 
 he received less attention  as a performer.","   His  shy,  introspective  personality  was  misunder- stood  as  snobbish  arrogance,  so  he  
was  offered few recording-session jobs.",C,2
"  The  author  mentions  Berry’s  solo  in  “Oh,  Lady  Be Good” primarily  in order to:",    illustrate  why most people haven't  heard of  Berry.,   provide an example  of  Berry's  musical excellence.,   contrast   Berry's  later   work   with  Berry’s  early work.,     establish  that  Berry’s  solo  was  better  than  Count Basie's.,C,3
"  The  author  points  out  that  many  serious  jazz  enthusi- asts know  little about Berry  
primarily  in order to:",   criticize  scholarship  that  has  provided  an  unbal- anced history  of  jazz.,   demonstrate  that the author is more knowledgeable than  most jazz scholars.,   illustrate  the  secrecy  Berry  demanded  in  order  to preserve his family's privacy.,   explain  why  it's likely  that  readers  would  be unf'a- miliar  with Berry.,B,3
"  According  to  the  author,  Berry’s  solos  as  a  recording- session  musician  were often 
very short  because  he:",    wasn't  a  very  good  saxophone  player  until  late  in his career.,   drew  more attention  playing ensemble passages.,   worked  within  the recording constraints  of  the era.,     preferred  play ing  many  short  solos  to  play ing  a few long ones.,D,3
"  The  author  indicates  that  during  Berry's  time  as  a musician, swing music  was 
primarily  regarded  as:",   an opportunity  for soloists to show  off  their skills.,   a genre to be most appreciated  by young  people.,    musician's  music that lacked a popular  audience.,   music for dance parties but  not music for study.,C,3
"  As  it  is  used  in  line  35,  the  word  court  most  nearly means  to:",    seek  to attract.,   romantically  pursue.,   dangerously  provoke.,     pass judgment  upon.,D,3
"  In  the  seventh  paragraph  (lines  57-75),  the  author compares  sidemen  to traveling  
salesmen  in order to:",   make clear how often musicians  had to travel.,   indicate  that  musicians  often had side jobs.,   illustrate  sidemen's  supportive  role in a band.,   show  how hard sidemen  worked to get hired.,A,3
  The  author  describes  Henderson's  “Blues  in  C  Sharp Minor”  as:,"    innovative, indulgent,  and colorful.","   fast-moving,  memorable,  and eerie.","   artful, sublime,  and  unexpectedly  upbeat.","     odd, haunting,  and relaxing.",C,3
"  According  to the author,  what  is unique  about  the June 1940 rendition of  the song “A 
Ghost of  a Chance”?",   It's  the  only  recorded  piece  that  features  Berry from beginning  to end.,   Berry  plays  an  alto saxophone  instead  of  his  usual tenor  saxophone.,   It  was  the  only  public  performance  Berry  gave  in 1940.,   Berry  showcases  his  unrivaled  ability  to  play  a solo that blends into the background.,D,3
"  The  author  uses  the  phrase  “a  cathedral  of  a  solo” (line 85) most  likely  to create  
a sense that Berry's  solo was:","    an intricate,  awe-inspiring  masterpiece.","   a somber,  mournful  hymn.",   a crumbling  remnant of’ Berry's once-great  skill.,     a testament  to Calloway's  band leadership.,A,3
  Which  of  the  following  statements  best  expresses  the main idea of  the passage?,   Bailin  began  studying  the  Sagittarius  Dwarf  when he was a graduate student in astronomy.,   The gravitational  tidal forces of  the Milky  Way are destroying  the Sagittarius  Dwarf.,"    Most  astronomers  have  come  to an  agreement  that evidence  about  how  galaxies  have  
formed  is,  at best, circumstantial.","   Evidence   suggests   that   the  warp  in  the  Milky Way's  disk  results  from  the  Milky  
Way's  interac- tion with a small satellite galaxy.",A,3
"  It  can  reasonably   be  inferred  that  the  problem  the author  mentions  in line 33 
refers to:",    a  particular  aspect  of  B ailin’s  theory  for  which there is little evidence.,   a  mathematical   computation   that  led  B ailin   to focus on the Sagittarius Dwarf.,   the  question  of  which  physical  processes  caused the warp in the Milky  Way.,     the  potential  impact  of  wobbly  gyrations  on  the Milky  Way’s rotation.,D,4
"  It can  reasonably  be inferred  from  the  passage  that  the small satellite galaxy  
referred  to in lines 35-36 is:",   the Small  Magellanic  Cloud.,   the Sagittarius  Dwarf.,    a known  but as yet unnamed  galaxy.,   a  hypothetical  galaxy  that  is  believed  to  exist  but has not yet been found.,C,4
"  Based  on  the  passage,  which  of  the  following  state- ments  best  describes  Bailin's  
study  as  it  relates  to  the field ot  astronomy?",    It led astronomers  to the discovery  of  a warp in  the Milky  Way’s disk.,   It convinced  more astronomers  to focus  their atten- tion on the center of  the Milky  Way.,    It  revealed  problems  with  the  basic  assumptions held by  most astronomers.,"     It provided  evidence  for an  idea  that  scientists  had long   considered   a  
possibility   but   had   not   yet proved.",B,4
"  According  to  the  passage,  Bailin  discovered  that  the angular  momentum  of  the warped  
portion  of  the Milky Way  and  the  angular  momentum  of  the  Sagittarius Dwarf  are:",   identical in quantity  but different  in direction.,   identical  in direction  but different  in quantity.,   identical in both quantity  and  direction.,   different  in both quantity and direction.,D,4
"  According  to  the  passage,  the  central  bulge  of  the Milky  Way  is comprised  of:",    80 percent of  the galaxy’s  stars.,   older stars and a black hole.,   a galactic  plane and several  dwarf  planets.,     a loose agglomeration  of  unidentified  matter.,C,4
  The author  refers  to  the swirling  pattern  of  a hurricane primarily  in order to:,   help  explain  the  shortcomings  of  the  plum-and- pizza metaphor.,"    argue  that  the  unpredictability  of  the  rotation  of spiral galaxies requires  a new  
metaphor.",   emphasize  the particular  aspects  of  the Milky  Way that make it unique.,   describe  how  the movement  of  the Milky  Way  cre- ates gravitational  tides.,B,4
  The passage directly  compares the Milky  Way’s disk as it is affected  by its warp to:,    a pasta  maker  churning out spaghetti.,   pizza dough  being  spun in the air by a chef.,   a thin-crust  pizza balanced on top of  a plum.,     two figure  skaters  coming  together  for  a  combina- tion spin.,A,4
"  According  to the passage, which of the following  state- ments  best  describes  the  
movement  of  the  Sagittarius Dwarf  with respect  to the Milky  Way?",   It appears  to be in a roughly  polar orbit around  the Milky  Way.,   It  appears  to  orbit  the  Milky  Way  at  an  angle  of roughly forty-five  degrees.,"   It  follows  the  movement  of  the  stars  in  the  Milky Way's disk,  though  at a slightly  
faster  rate.","   It  once  followed  the  movement  of  the  stars  in  the Milky  Way's  disk,  but  now  
seems  to  move  errati- cally  along its own path.",B,4
