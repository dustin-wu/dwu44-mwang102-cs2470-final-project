   The  narrator  draws  which  of  the  follo wing  compar- isons between  the old couple and  Eugene’ s parents?,   The  old  couple  were  more  socially  outgoing  and had many  more friends  than  Eugene’ s  parents.,    Eugene’ s  parents  are  just  as  interested  in  tending the lawn  and flowers  as the old  couple  were.,    Eugene’ s  parents  are  less  nurturing  of  each  other and spend less time together  than   the old couple did.,"   Just  like  the  old  man  and  old  woman,  both  ot Eugene’ s  parents  appear  to  have   jobs  outs ide  the home.",C,1
"  In  terms  of  developing  the  narrative,  the last two  para- graphs (1ines 67-87   primarily   serve  to:",    provide  background  details  about  the  narrator  and her  family   in  order  to   highlight   the  narrator’ s unique and shifting  perspective.,   describe the narrator’s  family  in order to establish  a contrast between  her parents and  Eugene's  parents.,   portray  the  narrator’ s family  in  order  to show  how her  friendship  with  Eugene   affected  the  various members  of  her family.,     depict  the  hopes  and  dreams  of  the  narrator’ s  par- ents  in  order  to  show  how   her  parents’  aspirations changed over time.,A,1
"   It  can  most  reasonably  be  interred  from  the  passage that  when  the  narrator  says,   “I  didn’t  see  the  red, yellow,  and  purple  clusters  that  meant   towers  to  me” (lines  30-31), she is most  nearly  indicating  that:","   trom  her  current  position,  she  couldn't  see  the old woman’ s  flowers,  which  were   still  growing  near the house.",    the  flo wers  grown  by  the  old  woman  had  died because  the narrator  had stopped   watering  them.,    the flowers  grown  by  the old  woman  had  been  cut down  when  Eugene's father  mowed   the lawn.,"   the  weeds  that  had  grown  up  in  the  old  couple’ s lawn  had intertwined  with  the  flowers,  making  the flowers hard to see.",A,1
"   Acc ording  to  the  narrator,   which   ot  the  fol1owin g statements  was true  about   Eugene  at the moment  when she first  talked  to him?","    Due  to  the  size  of  the  school,  he  had  not  even noticed  the narrator  until she  started  talking  to him.",   He  had  searched  unsuccessfully  for  the  narrator’ s locker several different  times  and  had  been too shy to ask someone  where it was.,   He  had  first  noticed  the  narrator  in  study  hall  but had  been  uninterested  in  her   until  she  introduced herself.,     He  had  apparently  taken  notice  of  the  narrator  at school  and  had  come  to  like   her  but  felt  nervous about  introducing  himself.,D,1
"   When  the  narrator  say s,  “I  began  to  think  of  the  pre- sent  more  than  at  the   future”  (lines  80—81),  she  most likely  means  that meeting  Eugene  led her to:",   shift  some  of  her  attention  away  from  her  career plans and onto  the developing  friendship.,    think  more  about  her  own  work  interests   than about  the  career  her  parents  though  t  she  should pursue.,    put  off  her  plans  of  returning  to  Puerto  Rico  tor  a visit in favor of continuing   to prepare  for college.,   want  to spend  more  time  with  him  instead  of  help- ing  her parents  plan  u  vacation   to Puerto Rico.,D,1
The  narrator  most  nearly  portrays  her  parents'  dreams as:,close  to  being  realized  because  of   her  rather’ s good  job.,somewhat  uncommon  among  the other residents of the f amily’ s build in g.,ones she has heard  about  many  times but that seem tar oft and  remote  to her.,ones  she  shares  with  her  parents  and  longs  to  ful- fill.,B,1
The narrator  claims  that she felt close  to the old couple because  she had:,1 istened  in  on  so  many  of  their  conversations  over the years.,helped  take  care  of  the  old  woman's  flowers  atter the woman’ s husband  had died.,been  able  to  watch  them  as  they  moved  through their entire house.,regularly observed  them  during  their  mealtimes.,C,1

"  As  she is revealed  in  the passage,  ER  is best  described as:",sociall y controversial  but quietly  cooperative.,politically  courageous  and socially  concerned.,morall y strong and  deeply  traditional.,personally  driven  but calmly  moderate.,D,2
The  author  presents  ER's  accomplishments  as  excep- tional because ER:,brought  politically  unpopular  views  to  the  fore- front of the nation's polities.,was  the  first  public  figure  to  introduce  political roles for women.,was  a  political  pioneer  struggling  alone  for  social reform.,replaced  community  action  with  more  powerful White House networks.,C,2
"  According  to  the  passage,  ER  believed  that  social reform should include all of  the  following EXCEPT:",promoting  community  action.,developing  universal education.,supporting  affordable  housing.,establishing involved  theories.,B,2
"  Based  on  the  passage,  ER's  approach  to  social  reform can best be characterized  as:",passionate and theoretical.,patient and flexible.,simplistic  and isolationist.,progressive  and determined.,A,2
"  It  can  reasonably  be  inferred  from  the  passage  that  at the  time  ER  began  working   for  social  reform,  the United States was:",deeply  committed   to  reforms  in  education  and health care.,   experiencing  a  time  of  national  prosperity  that contributed  to  ER's  ideals   concerning  the  public welfare.,   concentrating  on affairs at home due to isolationist policies  and the spread of democracy   overseas.,   unsupportive  of  the  idea  that  the  government  was responsible for the welfare of its  poor and neglected.,C,2

"   In  terms  of  the  passage  as  a  whole,  one  of  the  main functions  of  the  third   paragraph  (lines  13-19)  is  to suggest  that:",   ER's  successes  in  various  professional  pursuits helped  prepare  her  to  take  action   in  the  political world.,ER  had  avoided  the  political  spotlight  in  her  per- sonal  pursuits.,ER  had  competing  and conflicting  interests  during her first year as first lady.,"   while  ER  had  many  personal  accomplishments, little  could  have  prepared  her  for  life   as  the  first lady.",A,2
"  According  to the passage,  the primary  principle  under- lying ER's goals was that:",every person deserved a dignified  and decent life.,"   as  first  lady,  she  could  talk  about  things  that  had never been discussed before.","   through  radio  and  columns,  she  could  show  she was interested  in every person.",she must lead a bloodless  American  revolution.,A,2

"  In  the  context  of  the  passage,  the  author's  statement that  ER  “enjoyed  the  game,   and  weathered  the  abuse” (line 93) most nearly  means that ER:",enjoyed  her  individualist   adventure  in  politics even if criticized.,preferred  to  be  a  team  player  rather  than  take  the lead.,embraced  the  political  life  and  accepted  criticism as part of her work.,understood  political games and so did not take pol- itics or criticism  very  seriously.,A,2
Which  of  the  following  statements  best  describes  the structure of  this  passage?,   It  begins  and  ends  with  a  series  of  assertions  that surround  a  story  used  by  the   narrator  to  support and elaborate  on  those assertions.,   It  contains  a  highly  detailed  anecdote  that  the  nar- rator uses to show how  the  claims she makes  in the first paragraph  are wrong.,"    It  compares  and  contrasts  the  narrator’ s  perspec- tive on an incident  in her life  with the perspectives ot several  other  people, such  as her parents.",   It consists  mainly  of  a story  about a recent event in the narrator’ s life that she feels  taught her an  inter- esting  but  ultimately  insignificant  lesson.,B,3

Which  of  the  following  statements  best  paraphrases lines 5—8?,   The imagination  lacks value and should be ignored in favor of paying attention to the actual  world.,   Reason  can  enhance  the  imagination  but  at  the expense of experience in the actual  world.,"   Rather   than   become   isolated,   the  imagination should  connect  to  the  actual  world   at  least  occa- sionally.","   Reason,  not  the  imagination,  is  the  best  way  to appreciate and enrich the actual  world.",C,3
"  By  her  statements  in  lines  77—80,  the  narrator  is  most nearly  asserting that:","   in her  world, adults  are generally  considered  more important than children.","   she, like everyone and everything  else, was a small part of a larger world.",it  still  mattered  greatly  whether  people  saw  or ignored her.,she  was  less  valuable  than  other  people  in  her world.,A,3
