Passage I

LITERARY  NARRATIVE:  This  passage  is  adapted  from  the short  story  “From   Aboard   the   
Night   Train”  by   Kimberly   M. Blaeser  (@1993 by  Kimberly  M.  Blaeser),  which  appeared  in 
Earth  Song,  Sky Spirit:  Short  Stories  of  the  Contemporary Native  American Experience.

The  passage  begins  with  a  female  narrator  traveling  to  her hometown.

The moon gives some light and I can make out the contours of the land, see the faint reflection in 
the lakes and ponds we pass. Several times I see or imagine I see glowing eyes staring  back at me 
from a patch of  woods
5  beside the track. When  we pass through the tiny towns, I  try  to  read  their  signs,  catch  
their  names  from  their water  towers  or  grain  elevators.  Occasionally  the  train stops at 
...   Portage ...   Winona  ...   Red Wing.
In  my  sleeping  compartment,  watching  the  night
10  countryside, so much world rolls by my window. Like a voyeur  I  watch  the  various  reunion  
scenes. I feel  these scenes  add  up  to  something,  some  meaning  or  lesson about  all  life, 
and  I  try  to  put  it into  words  for  myself but find I can't. I finally  give up, roll over, 
go to sleep,
15  and dream.
But  now  I  am  awake,  keeping  my  vigil  over  the Midwest's  pastoral  kingdom. Chicago, even 
Minneapo- lis  seems  a  long  way  away.  A  few  hours  later,  still  in
Meat Market and the old Pioneer office. We rebuild  the Landmark  Hotel,  take  down  the  vinyl  
fronts  from  the grocery  store,  change  the  light  posts,  the  awnings,  the names  of  the  
current  businesses.  I  put  back  the  old
40  depot,  you  the  corner  funeral  home.  But  soon  we  are distracted  and  leave  things  
half  constructed  when  we begin  to  add  the  people,  what’s-his-name, the  square dance  
caller;  Ed,  the  fire  chief;  and  Lydia,  the  town's best gossip. On  the walk  back home, we 
have  begun  to
45  list  very  specific  things,  which  is  the closest  we get  to the  intangibles:  the  
rental  meat  lockers,  the  four-digit telephone  numbers,  the  free  ice  cream  during  dairy 
month.
Late  at  night  in  my  old  bed,  I  listen  to  the  night
50  sounds   of   the   house  and  fall  asleep  counting   the changes  that  have  come  to  my  
little  hometown:  The park  is  off  limits  after  dark  now,  the  football  field  is fenced 
in, one-hour  photo has come to town along  with a  tanning  salon  and  a pizza  parlor. The dry  
goods  store
55  is  gone, the  dairy, long  gone.  People  lock  their  houses now  more  than once a year  
when  the carnival  comes  to town.  But  all  of  these  changes  pale  in  comparison  to what  
has  replaced  the  bait  shop,  the  used  car  lot,  and Mr. Morton's  small farm, what has  
sprung  up on High-
60  way 59 at the edge of town: Las Vegas—style gambling.


Taking  the  train  back,  I  decide  to  put  on  pajamas and  crawl  under  the sheets, hoping  
to  trick  myself  into

the  deep  night  hours,  the  train  arrives  at  my  stop,
20  Detroit  Lakes,  Minnesota,  the  closest  I  can  get  to  my destination.
Suddenly,  as  I  descend  the  two  steps  from  the
train,  the  porter  hands  me  into  one  of  the  reunion scenes. “Hi, honey,  how  was  the 
trip? Did  you  get  any
a  good  night's  sleep.  It  seems  to  work.  I  have  slept 65  soundly  for  several  hours,  
but  then  the  dreams  start.  I fall in and out of them. But they are not the usual night- mares. 
 I  am  in  a  place  where  folks  know  you  ten, fif- teen, twenty  years after  you've left and 
still see in your face that of  your grandfather or aunt or cousin. I know I

25 sleep?” “A little. Been  waiting long?” “Long enough  to beat  your  dad in two games of 
cribbage    . . ” Glancing back  at  the train  windows, I imagine  I am looking  into eyes hidden 
behind mirrored sunglasses.


30          I  think  about  progress  a  lot  in  the  next  few  days and  about  what  passes  
for  progress.  Nightly  we  walk about town, talk  marriages  and funerals,  then sit on the newly 
 installed  benches  on  Main  Street.  Together  we assemble from our  memories  the town  as it 
was  twenty or twenty-five  years ago. We remember  the little Model

70  am home and I feel safe.
I have  an early  breakfast  with  a would-be  journal- ist  and  some  ski  vacationers  who  want 
 to  talk  about election  prospects.  I  merely  feign  attention.  I  nod  or laugh on cue, while 
I try to read upside-down  a story in
75  the would-be  journalist's  newspaper  that has caught my eye. It  is  about  the  Russian  
space  station  and  the  cos- monaut  who  had  been  up  in  orbit  during  the  takeover attempt 
 and  ultimate  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union. After  sixteen  long  months,  they  are  
bringing  the  cap-
80  sule back. While the train carries me back to my current home  and  away  from  my former, I 
keep thinking  about

that  poor  cosmonaut  coming  back  to  find  his  whole world   changed,   to   find   himself   
a   man   without   a country—at least without  the country  he left behind.

85           I  watch  the  ten  o'clock  national  news  broadcast.  I see him emerge from the 
capsule.  I see him try  to stand and  have  his  knees  buckle.  I  know  they  said  it  was 
because  he hadn't  been  able  to exercise for such  a long time,  but  I  wonder  if  his  
weak-kneed  feeling  might  not
90  have  more  to  do  with  what  he  saw  out  the  window  of the  space  station  and  with  
how  the  world  was  happen- ing around  without  him.

Passage III

HUMANITIES:  This passage  is  adapted  from  the  article  “Find- ing Philosophy”  by Colin McGinn 
(02003 by Prospect).

Descartes  (line  63)  refers  to  René  Descartes  (1596—1650),  a French mathematician, 
philosopher,  and scientist.

I  have  been  an  academic  philosopher  for  the  past
30  years.  I  came  from  an  academically   disinclined background  in  the  northeast  of  
England,  my  relatives being  mainly  coalminers  and  other  manual  workers.  I
5  was  the  first  in  my  family  to  attend  university,  and indeed  had no thought  of  it 
until  age 17, when  a teacher mentioned  it  at  school.  My  father  had  become  a  suc- cessful 
 builder, so we were not materially  deprived, and it  was  expected  that I would  become  some  
sort of  tech-
10  nical  worker.  The  idea  that  I  might  one  day  become  a profes sional  philosopher  was  
inconceivable  in  those days,  to  me  and  everyone  else.  I  was  simply  not  living in  a  
place  where  that  kind  of  thing  ever  happened;  it was  far  likelier—though  still  not  at  
all  likely—that  I
15  would  become  a  pop  star  (I  played  drums  in  a  rock band).

The  paperback  British  edition  of  my  memoir  The Makin g of  a  Philosc›yher  has  a 
photograph  on  the cover of  a man sitting on a bench,  placed in a grey and listless
20  landscape.  He  is  overlooking  the  sea  on  a  misty  grim day,  and  the  atmosphere  is  
bleak  and  melancholy.  The man,  hunched  up,  immobile,  coiled  almost,  has  a  pen- sive  
posture,  as  if  frozen  in  thought.  This  picture  is based  on  a  story  I  tell  in  the  
book  about  sitting  on  a
25  bench  in  Blackpool,  aged  18,  pondering  the  metaphysi- cal question  of  how  objects  
relate to their  properties.  Is an  object  just  the  sum  total  of  its  properties,  a  mere 
coalescence  of  general  features,  or does  it  somehow  lie behind  its  properties,  supporting 
 them,  a  solid  peg  on
30  which  they  happen  to  hang?  When  I  look  at  an  object do  I  really  see  the  object  
itself,  or  just  the  appearance its  properties  offer  to  me?  I  remember  the  feeling  of 
fixation  that  came  over  me  when  I  thought  about  these questions—a   kind   of   floating   
fascination,   a   still
35  perplexity.

When I look  back on this period in my late teens, I recall  the  harnessing  of  undirected  
mental  energy  by intellectual  pursuits.  Up  until  then,  my  mental  energy had  gone  into  
things  like reading  Melod y Maker, which
40  contained  fairly  serious  articles  about  pop  musicians;  I always  knew  the  top  20  off 
 by  heart,  and  studied  the articles  about  drummers  intensely,  hoping  to  improve my  own  
technique.  I suspect  that  this  kind  of  swashing mental  energy  is fairly  typical  of  boys  
that  age. School
45  doesn't  seem  to  connect  with  it,  and  it  goes  off   in search  of  some  object  of  
interest,  often  trivial,  some- times  destructive.  In  my  case,  it  was  philosophy  that 
seized  that  energy  and  converted  it  into  a  passion— though  one  that  took  several  years 
 to form  fully.  It  is  a

I  was  ten,  and  for  butterflies  and  lizards  before  that.
55  How   to  harness   such  passions   to  formal  education remains  a great and unresolved  
problem.

It  was—of  course—a  teacher  who  tapped  into  my formless  and  fizzing  mental  energy.  Mr  
Marsh,  teacher of  divinity,  brimmingly  Christian,  a  man  with  very
60  active  eyebrows  and  sharp  enunciation,  in  love  with scholarship  (oh,  how  he  relished 
 that  word)—it  was  he who first  brought  out my  inner  philosopher.  From him I heard  of  
Descartes,  locked  up  in  his  room,  wondering whether  anything  could  really  be  known  
beyond  his
65  own  existence.  But  what  I mainly  got from  the enthusi- astic  Mr  Marsh  was  the  desire 
 to  study.  His  own  pas- sion  for  study  shone  through,  and  he  managed  to  make it  seem, 
 if  not  glamorous,  then  at  least  exhilarating— when  done  the  right  way  and  in  the 
right  spirit.  Pencils
70  and  stationery  were  made  to  seem  like  shiny  tools,  and the  pleasure  of  making  
one's  mark  on  a  blank  sheet  of paper  hy mned.  Choosing  a  good  spot  to  study   was 
emphas ised.   Above   all,   I   learned   a   very   valuable lesson,  one  that  had  hitherto  
escaped  me:  make  notes.
75  Thinking  and  writing  should  be  indissoluble  activities, the  hand  ministering  to the 
thought,  the  thought  shaped by  the  hand.  Today,  if  I  find  myself  without  pen  and paper 
 and  thoughts  start  to  arrive,  my  fingers  begin  to twitch  and  I  long  tor  those  
implements  of  cog itation.
80  With   such   rudimentary   tools   you   can   perform   the miracle  of  turning  an  
invisible  thought  into  a  concrete mark,  bringing   the  ethereal  interior  into  the  public 
external  world,  refining  it  into  something  precious  and permanent.  The  physical  pleasure  
of  writing,  which  I
85  find  survives  in  the  use  of  a  computer,  is  something worth dwelling  on in matters  of 
education.








21.  The  passage  is  best  described  as  being  told  from  the point of  view of  a philosopher 
 who is:
A.   discussing  metaphysical  questions  that  have  trou- bled  philosophers  since the time of  
Descartes.
B.    presenting  in chronological  order  the key events  in his thirty-year  professional  
career.
C.   reflecting  on  his  own  early,  developing  interest  in philosophy  and in scholarship  
generally.
D.   advising   professional  educators   on  how  to  get more students  to study philosophy.

22.  Based on the passage, which of  the following  was most likely   the   first   to  engage   
the   author's   passionate interest?
F.    Drumming
G.   Philosophy
H.   Chemistry
J.     Butterflies

50  delicate  and  fastidious  energy  that  I  am  speaking  ot, despite its power, and it will  
only  be satisfied  by certain employments,   which  of   course  vary  from  person  to person.  I 
 had  had  a  similar  passion  for chemistry  when
ACT-67C- PRACTICE

23.  The main purpose of the last paragraph is to:
A.   reveal  the enduring  impact  of  Mr. Marsh's  lessons on the author.
B.   acknowledge  that  the  author  came  to  doubt  some of Mr. Marsh's teachings.
C.   describe a typical class as taught by Mr. Marsh.
D.   present a biographical sketch of Mr. Marsh.

24.  The  passage  indicates  that  the  man  in  the  book-cover photograph  represents:
F.    Descartes,  wondering  what could be known.
G.   Mr. Marsh, deep in scholarly  thought.
H.   the   author   at   age   seventeen,   thinking   about enrolling in college.
J.    the author  at  age eighteen,  contemplating  a philo- sophical issue.

25.  The  author  mentions  Melod y  Maker,  the  top  20,  and articles about musicians  primarily 
to suggest that his:
A.   early  interest  in  music  has  remained  with  him  to the present.
B.   time spent playing music should instead have been spent reading.
C.   fascination  with  pop  music  and  musicians  gave focus to his life for a time.
D.   commitment  to  study  enabled  him  to  perfect  his drumming technique.

26.  In  the  third  paragraph  (lines  36-56),  the  author  most nearly characterizes  the energy 
 he refers to as:
F.    potent  yet  difficult  to  channel  in  a  constructive way.
G.   powerful   and   typically   leading   to  destructive results.
H.   delicate     and    inevitably     wasted     in    trivial undertakings.
J.    gentle yet capable of  uniting  people who have dif- ferent interests.

                           37

27.  Viewed  in  the context  of  the  passage,  the statement  in lines 55—56 is most likely

Passage IV

NATURAL  SCIENCE:  This  passage  is  adapted  from  Consider the Eel by Richard Schweid (@2002 by 
Richard Schweid).

The  known  Iacts,  as  they  are  pretty  much  univer- sally  accepted  among  biologists  and  
naturalists  today, are  that  all  the  eels  in  all  the  rivers  ot  eastern  North America  
and  the Caribbean  countries,  and all the eels in
5  all the rivers of  eastern  and  western  Europe,  are born  in the  same  area  of  the  
Sargasso  Sea,  a  huge  area  within the  Atlantic  Ocean,  between  Bermuda  and  the  Azores, 
the  surface  of  which  is frequently  covered  with  sargas- sum  seaweed.  In fact,  the  word  
“Sargasso”  comes  from
10  the  Portuguese  sargaqo,  meaning  seaweed.  The  sea  is about  2,000  miles  long  and  
1,000  miles  wide,  set  off from  the  surrounding  waters  of  the  Atlantic  by  strong 
currents.  It  includes  the  area  known  in  popular  legend as the Bermuda Triangle.

15           Eels hatch  in  the Sargasso  as larvae and are carried by  the  ocean  currents  to  
either  Europe  or  the  United States,  a journey  that  can  cover  thousands  of  miles  and 
take years. Where they end  up depends on  which  of  two similar  species  they  belong  to.  
Those  that  are  An guilla
20  ang uilla  invariably   wind  up  in  European  rivers,  and those that enter North  American  
rivers always belong to the  species  Anguilla  rostrata.  The  first  person  to  find eel  larvae 
 in  the  Sargasso  Sea  was  Danish  researcher Johannes  Schmidt,  who  published  his findings  
in  1924,
25  after spending  18 years  hauling  nets in search  of  eels.
The  larvae  of  both  species  are  shaped  like  small oval  leaves  and  are  called  
leptocephali.  Each  lepto- cephalus  begins  to assume  the form  of  a  tiny eel, called an  
elver  or glass eel,  when  it gets  close  to the coasts  of
30  either  Europe  or  the  Americas.  By  the  time  it  reaches brackish  water,  where fresh 
and salt water mix, it is thin and  transparent,  hardly  bigger  than  a hair,  with  a pair of 
eyes like black dots at one end.
From  the  estuaries  and  mouths  of  rivers,  the  tiny
35  eels   t requently   continue   upstream,   particularly   the females,  who  sometimes  go  
great  distances  inland. American  eels  have  been  found  as  far  up  the  Miss is- sippi  
River  system  as  the  rivers  of  Iowa.  They  keep going   upriver   until   something   tell s  
 them   they’ ve
40  reached  home,  and  then  they  stop.  Whatever  it  is  that signals  to  eels  that  they  
are  home  is  definitive—they settle  in and  live  there  for as long  as  20  years,  growing up 
to a yard long  before beginning  their journey  back  to the  S argas so  S ea.   Scientists  
determine  an  ee1’s  age
45  using  a  microscope   to  read  the  growth   rings  of  its otolith—a  small,  hard  calcium  
deposit  at the base of  its skull.

In  preparation  for  the  return  journey  to  the  Sar- gasso, sexually  mature female eels feed 
voraciously  and
50  change  color  from  the  muddy-yellow/green  of  adult eels,  often  called  yellow  eels,  to 
 a  darker  green  on  top and  snow-white  on  their  bellies.  At  this  stage,  they  are called 
 silver  eels.  They  swim  downriver  in  the  fall,  on the  first  leg  of  their  journey  to  
the  Sargasso,  and  when
ACT-67C- PRACTICE                                                                                   
                                                           38

55  they  reach  estuarine  waters,  they  rest,  completing  their final  transformation as silver 
eels. They  will have eaten heavily  and  will  be  about  28  percent  body  fat.  They will  
never  eat  again,  and  their  digestive  systems  will atrophy.  Their  pupils  will  expand  and 
 turn  blue.  They
60  will  need  a  new  kind  of  sight  adapted  to  the  depths  of the  sea,  where  there  is  
little  light.  They  will  also  have to go through  a drastic  adjustment,  via osmosis,  in 
their blood  chemistry,  to  prepare  for  the  tremendous  change in  water  pressure,  going from 
some 14 pounds  of  fresh-
65  water  pressure  per  inch  of  their  bodies  to  over  a  ton  of ocean  pressure  per  inch. 
 Once  they  are  back  in  the Sar- gasso  Sea,  the  females  produce  eggs  for  the  males  to 
fertilize, and then  the adults die.
At  least  that  is  what  today's  marine  biologists  and
70  naturalists  tell  us,  although  adult  eels  have  never  been seen  swimming,  reproducing,  
or  dying  in  the Sargasso. In fact, live adult eels have never  been  seen  there at all. The  
only  two  adult  eels  ever  reported  in  the  Sargasso Sea were dead, found  in  the stomachs  
of  other fish. The
75  eel's  migration  back  to  its  birthplace  and  what  it  actu- ally  does  when  it  gets  
there  are  assumed  to  take  place far  below  the  water's  surface  and,  as  of  the  year  
2001, were  stil1  completely  unobserved.   However,  the  eel larvae—the  leptocephali  that 
Schmidt  found  in the Sar-
80  gasso—were  so  small  that  it  was  certain  they  had  been born  recently,  and  nearby. 
Such  small larvae have never been  seen  elsewhere,  and  while  eels  have  never  been observed  
reproducing  in  the  Sargasso,  they  have  never been  seen  doing  so  an yp1ace  else  either.  
Sci enti s ts
85  believe  the  larvae  hatch  out  of  eggs  at  a  depth  of 100-300  yards  and  rise  slowly  
toward  the  light  at  the sea's surface.





31.  One  of  the  main  ideas  established  by  the  passage  is that:
A.   researchers  have  nearly  exhausted  their  resources after  spending  decades  investigating 
 the  Sargasso Sea.
B.    significant  gaps  still  remain  in  researchers'  under- standing  of  the life cycle of  
eels.
C.   eels  live  their  entire  lives  in  the Sargasso  Sea,  but no one has ever seen them there.
D.   female  eels  turn  into  silver  eels  toward  the  end  of their lives.

32.  Learning  about  which  of  the  following  had  the  largest impact  on  scientists'  current 
 understanding  of  where eels breed?
F.    The  direction  in  which  ocean  currents  carry  eel larvae
G.   The  relations hip  of  the  yellow  eel  stage  to  the silver eel stage
H.   Schmidt's  discovery  of  eel  larvae  in  the  Sargasso Sea
J.     The adult eels found in  the stomachs  ot other tish

33.  The   main   purpose   of   the   fourth   paragraph is to describe  the:
A.   eels'  transition  from freshwater  to the ocean.
B.   method  of  determining  the age of eels.
C.   complexity  of  the Mississippi  River system.

F.    the Azores.
G.   several Caribbean countries.
H.   powerful  winds.
J.     strong currents.

35.  The passage notes  that the Sargasso Sea includes:
A.   the eastern  North  American  shore.
B.    the Bermuda Triangle.
C.   certain coastal estuaries.
D.   the mouth of  the Mississippi River.

36.  As it  is  used  in  line  13,  the  word  popular  most  nearly means:
