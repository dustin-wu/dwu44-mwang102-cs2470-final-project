This passage is adapted from George Eliot, Silas Marner.
Originally published in 1861. Silas was a weaver and a
notorious miser, but then the gold he had hoarded was
stolen. Shortly after, Silas adopted a young child, Eppie, the
daughter of an impoverished woman who had died
suddenly.

Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must
be worshipped in close-locked solitude—which was
hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song
of birds, and started to no human tones—Eppie was a
creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires,
seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and
living movements; making trial of everything, with
trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in
all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his
thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to
nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object
compacted of changes and hopes that forced his
thoughts onward, and carried them far away from
their old eager pacing towards the same blank
limit—carried them away to the new things that
would come with the coming years, when Eppie
would have learned to understand how her father
Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of
that time in the ties and charities that bound together
the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that

he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened
and blinded more and more to all things except the
monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web;
but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and
made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening
his senses with her fresh life, even to the old
winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early
spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because
she had joy.
And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting,
so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows,
Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the
late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening
under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered
head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where
the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank
where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to
pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged
things that murmured happily above the bright
petals, calling “Dad-dad’s” attention continually by
bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her
ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to
please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that
they might listen for the note to come again: so that
when it came, she set up her small back and laughed
with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this
way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs
again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline
and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of
crowding remembrances from which he turned away
timidly, taking refuge in Eppie’s little world, that lay
lightly on his enfeebled spirit.

As the child’s mind was growing into knowledge,
his mind was growing into memory: as her life
unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow
prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually
into full consciousness.
It was an influence which must gather force with
every new year: the tones that stirred Silas’ heart
grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers;
shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie’s eyes and
ears, and there was more that “Dad-dad” was
imperatively required to notice and account for.
Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she
developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for
devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which
found much exercise, not only for Silas’ patience, but
for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor
Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible
demands of love.

MIT business scholars Erik Brynjolfsson and
Andrew McAfee have argued that impressive
advances in computer technology—from improved
industrial robotics to automated translation
services—are largely behind the sluggish
employment growth of the last 10 to 15 years. Even
more ominous for workers, they foresee dismal
prospects for many types of jobs as these powerful
new technologies are increasingly adopted not only
in manufacturing, clerical, and retail work but in
professions such as law, financial services, education,
and medicine.
That robots, automation, and software can replace
people might seem obvious to anyone who’s worked
in automotive manufacturing or as a travel agent. But
Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s claim is more troubling
and controversial. They believe that rapid
technological change has been destroying jobs faster
than it is creating them, contributing to the
stagnation of median income and the growth of
inequality in the United States. And, they suspect,
something similar is happening in other
technologically advanced countries.
As evidence, Brynjolfsson and McAfee point to a
chart that only an economist could love. In
economics, productivity—the amount of economic
value created for a given unit of input, such as an
hour of labor—is a crucial indicator of growth and
wealth creation. It is a measure of progress. On the
chart Brynjolfsson likes to show, separate lines
represent productivity and total employment in the
United States. For years after World War II, the
two lines closely tracked each other, with increases in
jobs corresponding to increases in productivity. The
pattern is clear: as businesses generated more value
from their workers, the country as a whole became
richer, which fueled more economic activity and
created even more jobs. Then, beginning in 2000, the

lines diverge; productivity continues to rise robustly,
but employment suddenly wilts. By 2011, a
significant gap appears between the two lines,
showing economic growth with no parallel increase
in job creation. Brynjolfsson and McAfee call it the
“great decoupling.” And Brynjolfsson says he is
confident that technology is behind both the healthy
growth in productivity and the weak growth in jobs.
It’s a startling assertion because it threatens the
faith that many economists place in technological
progress. Brynjolfsson and McAfee still believe that
technology boosts productivity and makes societies
wealthier, but they think that it can also have a dark
side: technological progress is eliminating the need
for many types of jobs and leaving the typical worker
worse off than before. Brynjolfsson can point to a
second chart indicating that median income is failing
to rise even as the gross domestic product soars. “It’s
the great paradox of our era,” he says. “Productivity
is at record levels, innovation has never been faster,
and yet at the same time, we have a falling median
income and we have fewer jobs. People are falling
behind because technology is advancing so fast and
our skills and organizations aren’t keeping up.”
While technological changes can be painful for
workers whose skills no longer match the needs of
employers, Lawrence Katz, a Harvard economist,
says that no historical pattern shows these shifts
leading to a net decrease in jobs over an extended
period. Katz has done extensive research on how
technological advances have affected jobs over the
last few centuries—describing, for example, how
highly skilled artisans in the mid-19th century were
displaced by lower-skilled workers in factories.
While it can take decades for workers to acquire the
expertise needed for new types of employment, he
says, “we never have run out of jobs. There is no
long-term trend of eliminating work for people. Over
the long term, employment rates are fairly
stable. People have always been able to create new
jobs. People come up with new things to do.”
Still, Katz doesn’t dismiss the notion that there is
something different about today’s digital
technologies—something that could affect an even
broader range of work. The question, he says, is
whether economic history will serve as a useful

CO NTI N U E

guide. Will the job disruptions caused by technology
be temporary as the workforce adapts, or will we see
a science-fiction scenario in which automated
processes and robots with superhuman skills take
over a broad swath of human tasks? Though Katz
expects the historical pattern to hold, it is “genuinely
a question,” he says. “If technology disrupts enough,
who knows what will happen?”

Fly in a V Formation.” ©2014 by American Association for

Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that
migrating birds fly in a V formation, but scientists
have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds
that these big-winged birds carefully position their
wingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch
the preceding bird’s updraft—and save energy
during flight.
There are two reasons birds might fly in a
V formation: It may make flight easier, or they’re
simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can
save fuel by flying in a V formation, and many
scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same.
Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing
airplanes estimate that they save energy by drafting
off each other, but currents created by airplanes are
far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off
of a bird. “Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a
flapping wing,” says James Usherwood, a locomotor
biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at the
University of London in Hatfield, where the research
took place.
The study, published in Nature, took advantage of
an existing project to reintroduce endangered
northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.
Scientists used a microlight plane to show
hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route
from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried
data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab.
The device’s GPS determined each bird’s flight
position to within 30 cm, and an accelerometer
showed the timing of the wing flaps.
Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the
birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to
the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats
to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew
directly behind another, the timing of the flapping
reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the
downdraft coming off the back of the bird’s body.
“We didn’t think this was possible,” Usherwood
says, considering that the feat requires careful
flight and incredible awareness of one’s neighbors.
“Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought
of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and
down.”

The findings likely apply to other long-winged
birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood
says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that
would make drafting too difficult. The researchers
did not attempt to calculate the bird’s energy savings
because the necessary physiological measurements
would be too invasive for an endangered species.
Previous studies estimate that birds can use
20 percent to 30 percent less energy while
flying in a V.
“From a behavioral perspective it’s really a
breakthrough,” says David Lentink, a mechanical
engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto,
California, who was not involved in the work.
“Showing that birds care about syncing their wing
beats is definitely an important insight that we didn’t
have before.”
Scientists do not know how the birds find
that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that
the animals align themselves either by sight or
by sensing air currents through their feathers.
Alternatively, they may move around until they find
the location with the least resistance. In future
studies, the researchers will switch to more common
birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to
investigate how the animals decide who sets the
course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by
the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to
cause traffic jams.
“It’s a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but
it does suggest that there’s a lot more to learn,”
says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight
aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do
it, he says, “birds are awfully good hang-glider
pilots.”

I have shown how democracy destroys or
modifies the different inequalities which originate in
society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect
that great inequality of man and woman which has
seemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based
in human nature? I believe that the social changes
which bring nearer to the same level the father and
son, the master and servant, and superiors and
inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman and
make her more and more the equal of man. But here,
more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself
clearly understood; for there is no subject on which
the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a
freer range.
There are people in Europe who, confounding
together the different characteristics of the sexes,
would make of man and woman beings not only
equal but alike. They would give to both the same
functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant
to both the same rights; they would mix them in all
things—their occupations, their pleasures, their
business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus
attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both
are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of
the works of nature nothing could ever result but
weak men and disorderly women.
It is not thus that the Americans understand that
species of democratic equality which may be
established between the sexes. They admit, that as
nature has appointed such wide differences between
the physical and moral constitution of man and
woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct
employment to their various faculties; and they hold

that improvement does not consist in making beings
so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in
getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in
the best possible manner. The Americans have
applied to the sexes the great principle of political
economy which governs the manufactures of our age,
by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of
woman, in order that the great work of society may
be the better carried on.

As society was constituted until the last few
generations, inequality was its very basis; association
grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be
equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly
coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable
relation, without the law’s appointing that one of
them should be the superior of the other.
Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things
now tend to substitute, as the general principle of
human relations, a just equality, instead of the
dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that
between men and women, being the nearest and
most intimate, and connected with the greatest
number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to
throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for,
in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the
tenacity with which it clings to the forms and
circumstances with which it has even accidentally
become associated. . . .
. . . The proper sphere for all human beings is the
largest and highest which they are able to attain to.
What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete
liberty of choice. . . . Let every occupation be open to
all, without favor or discouragement to any, and
employments will fall into the hands of those men or
women who are found by experience to be most
capable of worthily exercising them. There need be
no fear that women will take out of the hands of men
any occupation which men perform better than they.

Nearly a half-century ago, Peter Higgs and a
handful of other physicists were trying to understand
the origin of a basic physical feature: mass. You can
think of mass as an object’s heft or, a little more
precisely, as the resistance it offers to having its
motion changed. Push on a freight train (or a
feather) to increase its speed, and the resistance you
feel reflects its mass. At a microscopic level, the
freight train’s mass comes from its constituent
molecules and atoms, which are themselves built
from fundamental particles, electrons and quarks.
But where do the masses of these and other
fundamental particles come from?
When physicists in the 1960s modeled the
behavior of these particles using equations rooted in
quantum physics, they encountered a puzzle. If they
imagined that the particles were all massless, then
each term in the equations clicked into a perfectly
symmetric pattern, like the tips of a perfect
snowflake. And this symmetry was not just
mathematically elegant. It explained patterns evident
in the experimental data. But—and here’s the
puzzle—physicists knew that the particles did have
mass, and when they modified the equations to
account for this fact, the mathematical harmony was
spoiled. The equations became complex and
unwieldy and, worse still, inconsistent.
What to do? Here’s the idea put forward by Higgs.
Don’t shove the particles’ masses down the throat of
the beautiful equations. Instead, keep the equations
pristine and symmetric, but consider them operating
within a peculiar environment. Imagine that all of
space is uniformly filled with an invisible
substance—now called the Higgs field—that exerts a
drag force on particles when they accelerate through
it. Push on a fundamental particle in an effort to
increase its speed and, according to Higgs, you would

feel this drag force as a resistance. Justifiably, you
would interpret the resistance as the particle’s mass.
For a mental toehold, think of a ping-pong ball
submerged in water. When you push on the
ping-pong ball, it will feel much more massive than it
does outside of water. Its interaction with the watery
environment has the effect of endowing it with mass.
So with particles submerged in the Higgs field.
In 1964, Higgs submitted a paper to a prominent
physics journal in which he formulated this idea
mathematically. The paper was rejected. Not because
it contained a technical error, but because the
premise of an invisible something permeating space,
interacting with particles to provide their mass, well,
it all just seemed like heaps of overwrought
speculation. The editors of the journal deemed it “of
no obvious relevance to physics.”
But Higgs persevered (and his revised paper
appeared later that year in another journal), and
physicists who took the time to study the proposal
gradually realized that his idea was a stroke of genius,
one that allowed them to have their cake and eat it
too. In Higgs’s scheme, the fundamental equations
can retain their pristine form because the dirty work
of providing the particles’ masses is relegated to the
environment.
While I wasn’t around to witness the initial
rejection of Higgs’s proposal in 1964 (well, I was
around, but only barely), I can attest that by the
mid-1980s, the assessment had changed. The physics
community had, for the most part, fully bought into
the idea that there was a Higgs field permeating
space. In fact, in a graduate course I took that
covered what’s known as the Standard Model of
Particle Physics (the quantum equations physicists
have assembled to describe the particles of matter
and the dominant forces by which they influence
each other), the professor presented the Higgs field
with such certainty that for a long while I had no idea
it had yet to be established experimentally.
On occasion, that happens in physics. Mathematical
equations can sometimes tell such a convincing tale,
they can seemingly radiate reality so strongly, that
they become entrenched in the vernacular of
working physicists, even before there’s data to
confirm them.

New theories, 12 new practices too, and
technologies are transforming the twenty-first-century

meaningful professional development is a shared
responsibility: it is the responsibility of employers to
provide useful programs, and it is also the responsibility

The Evolution of Slow Food
In 1986, McDonald’s caused a stir in Italy when it
opened a restaurant next to Rome’s historic Spanish
Steps. Young, on-the-go eaters were thrilled;
23 specifically, those who prized regional foods and
Italy’s convivial culture built on cooking and long meals
feared that the restaurant signaled the death of a way of
life. To counter the rise of fast food and fast 24 life, a
cohort of chefs, journalists, and sociologists spearheaded
a Slow Food movement, declaring loyalty to unhurried
enjoyment. 25
From its beginning, the movement 26 had opposed
the standardization of taste that fast food chains promote.
For example, a McDonald’s hamburger made in Boston
tastes more or less the same as one made in Beijing. This
consistency is made possible by industrial mass
production. Slow Food supporters, by contrast, back
methods of growing and preparing food based on
regional culinary traditions. When produced using
traditional methods, goat cheese made in France tastes
different from goat cheese made in Vermont. A goat

have also asked if growing food using traditional
methods, as opposed to mass production, 32 can
adequately and affordably feed the world? Given the
hectic pace of modern life, who among us has the time
and resources for elaborate meals? Such questions, in
addition to environmental concerns, are at the heart of
perennial debates about food production.
Over time, Slow Food has broadened its mission to
focus on food that is good, clean, and fair for all.
Members assert that food should be flavorful, carrying
the properties of a particular region; it should be raised
using environmentally sustainable practices that preserve
biodiversity; and it should be accessible to all without
exploiting the labors of those who produced it. 33 In
short, Slow Food runs programs that support small-scale
producers in marketing regional foods in a world where
food corporations threaten to drive them out of the
marketplace and homogenize food choices.

Was the Hoax a Hoax?
For an hour on the evening of October 30, 1938,
Orson Welles and other performers from the Mercury
Theatre flooded the airwaves with alarming “news
bulletins” about a Martian invasion supposedly occurring
in Grover’s Mill, New Jersey. They were performing a
radio play adapted from The War of the Worlds,
a science fiction novel by H. G. Wells. The next day, a
front-page 34 headline in the New York Times declared,
“Radio Listeners in Panic, Taking War Drama as Fact.”
35 The Times article claimed that people had fled their
homes and that police stations had been swamped with
calls. This version of events persisted, and the legend
became that Welles’s broadcast had as many as twelve
million people 36 who feared that Martians had invaded
Earth.
Recently, however, scholars have questioned the
accuracy of this legend, suggesting the degree of public
hysteria has been grossly exaggerated. The authors of an
article published in October 2013 go 37 so far to assign
blame for the distortion to the newspaper industry.

both professors of communication studies, argue that the
newspaper industry sought to discredit the newly
emerging technology of radio, which was cutting into
newspapers’ 39 profits. The newspaper industry tried to
do this by portraying the new medium as irresponsible.
[1] Proof of ulterior motives is scarce,
40 consequently weakening Pooley and Socolow’s
argument. [2] For instance, the C. E. Hooper ratings
indicate that a mere 2 percent of households had tuned in
to the broadcast. [3] Pooley and Socolow also call into
question the validity of an oft-cited report that was based
on a survey conducted six weeks after the broadcast.
[4] Just because some people found the broadcast
unsettling, the authors contend, doesn’t mean they
believed it and reacted with real terror. [5] According to
this report, one million people indicated that they had
been “frightened” by the broadcast. [6] Ratings, however,
