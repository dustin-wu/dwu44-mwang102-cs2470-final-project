Adaptations  of  plants  to deserts  include  dormancy and  a  variety  of  structural  and  
behavioral  adaptations. The  majority  of  desert  plants  depend  on  a strategy  that 
capitalizes  on  small  size.  They  are  annuals  that  spring
up  from  dry,  dormant,  heat-resistant  seeds.  Some  of these  seeds  may  wait  up  to  half 
 a  century  before  they are  activated.  The  plants'   challenge  is  to  be  quick enough  to 
respond  to rain so that they can  produce  their seeds before  the earth dries up again,  while 
not jumping
the gun  to start growth  until there is sufficient  water for them  to  grow  to  maturity  
for  seed  production.  Some achieve  this  balance  on  a  tightrope  by  “measuring” rainfall.  
They  have  chemicals  in their  seeds  that inhibit germination,  and a minimum amount  of  rain 
is required
before  these  are  leached  out.  Others  have  seed  coats that  must  be  mechanically  
scarred  to  permit  sufficient wetting  for  germination,  and  the  scarring  happens  only when  
they  are  subjected  to flash  floods in the riverbeds where  they  grow.  A  plant  in  the  
Negev  Desert  releases
its  seed  from  a  tough  capsule  only  under  the  influence of  water  through  a  
mechanism  that resembles  a  Roman ballistic  machine.  Its  two  outer  sepals  generate  side- 
ways  tension  that  can  fling  two  seeds  out  of  the  fruit, but  the  two  seeds  are  held  
inside  by  a lock  mechanism
at  the  top.  However,  when  the  sepals  are  sufficiently wetted,  then  the tension  
increases  to such  an extent  that the  lock  mechanism  snaps,  and  the  capsule  “explodes” and 
releases the seeds.
In moist regions  where  it rains predictably  (though not  necessarily   in  abundance),   we  
help  agricultural plants  to capture  the precipitation  by  scarring  the  soil to facilitate  
the  infiltration  of  the  water  into  it,  and  hence into  the roots. Least runoff  and maximum 
 water  absorp- tion  are  achieved  by  plowing  the  soil.  However,  such  a
 strategy  would  not  work  in  a  true  desert  such  as  the Negev.  A  different  program  
is  required  there  because rain  is  infrequent  and  plowing  would  facilitate  only  the 
evaporation  of  scarce  water  from  the  soil.  The  solution applied  by  the peoples  who 
inhabited  the Negev  in past
centuries  was  a  practice  they  called  “runoff  farming.” Farmers  had  mastered  
harnessing   the  flash  floods  that rush  down  into  the  gullies  by  catching  the  
runoffs—not only  by  making  terraces  but  also  by  building  large  cis- terns  into  which  
the  water  was  directed  to  be  held  for
later use. Remnants  of these  constructions  still exist.
Water-storage  mechanisms  have  been  invented  by other  organisms  living  in  deserts,  but  
mainly  through modifications  of  body  plan.  Many  plants,  especially cacti and euphorbia,  
have  the ability  to swell their roots

transferred  into  its  tall  trunk.  This  trunk  is  pleated  like an  accordion  and  can  swell 
 to  store  tons  of  water  that can  last  the  plant  for  a  year.  The cactus  has  no  
leaves, but  the  stem  is green  and  can  photosynthesize  and  pro-
duce nutrients as well as store water. The saguaro's sur- vival  strategy  requires  it to grow 
 extremely  slowly.  But it lives a century or more.
Some  desert  animals  similarly  store  water.  The frog  C yc'lorunu  plat yc'ephulu,  from  the  
northern  Australian  desert,  fills  up  and  greatly  expands  its  urinary bladder  to  use  as  a  water 
 bag  before  burying  itself  in the  soil,  where  it  spends  most  of  the  year  waiting  for 
the  next  rain.  While  in  the  ground  it  sloughs  off  skin and forms  around  itself a nearly 
 waterproof  cocoon  that
resembles  a  plastic  bag  and  reduces  evaporative  water loss.

Desert  ants  of  a  variety   of  species  (of  at  least seven  different  genera)  in  American  
as  well  as  Aus- tralian  deserts  collectively  called  “honeypot  ants”  have
evolved  a  solution  that  combines  water  storage  with energy   storage.   Ants  typically  
 feed  each  other;  and some  of  the  larger  worker  ants  may  take  up more  liquid than  the  
others,  and  others  may  bring  more.  Those  that take  the  fluid  may  gorge  themselves  
until  they  distend
their  abdomens  up to the  size  of a grape,  by  which  time they  are  unable  to  move  
from  the  spot.  They  then  hang in  groups  of  dozens  to  hundreds  from  the  ceiling  of  a 
chamber  in  the  ant  nest,  where  they  are  then  the  spe- cialized  so-called  repletes  that 
 later  regurgitate  fluid
when  the  colony  members  are  no  longer  bringing   the fluid in but rather needing  it.
