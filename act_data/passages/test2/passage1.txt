There  was  only  one  source  of  beauty  and  light  for me  my  ninth  grade  year.  The  only  
thing  I  had  antici- pated  at  the  start  of  the  semester.  That  was  seeing Eugene.  In  
August,  Eugene  and  his  family  had  moved
into  the  only  house  on  the  block  that  had  a  yard  and trees. I could  see his place 
from  my  bedroom  window  in El Building.  In fact, if I sat on the fire escape I was liter- ally  
suspended  above  Eugene’ s  backyard.  It  was  my favorite  spot  to  read  my  library  books  
in  the  summer.
Until that August  the house had  been occupied  by an old couple.  Over  the  years  I  had  
become  part  ot   their family,  without  their  knowing  it, of  course.  I had a  view of  their 
 kitchen  and  their  backyard,  and  though  1 could not hear what they  said, I knew  when  they  
were arguing,
when  one  of  them  was  sick,  and  many  other  things.  I knew all this by  watching them 
at mealtimes.  I could  see their  kitchen  table,  the sink,  and  the stove.  During  good times, 
 he sat  at  the  table  and  read  his  newspapers  while she  fixed  the  meals.  If  they  
argued,  he  would  leave  and
the old  woman  would  sit  and  stare  at  nothing  for a long time.  When  one ot  them  was 
sick,  the other would  come and  get  things  irom  the  kitchen  and  carry  them out  on  a 
tray. The old man  had died in June. The house had stood empty  for  weeks.  I  had  had  to  
resist  the  temptation  to
climb  down  into  the  yard  and  water  the  flowers  the  old lady had taken such good care 
of.

By  the  time  Eugene’ s  family  moved  in,  the  yard was  a tangled  mass ot  weeds.  The father 
 had  spent  several  days  mowing,  and  when  he  finished,  irom  where  I
sat,  I didn’ t see  the red, yellow,  and  purple clusters  that meant flowers  to me. I 
didn't see this iamily  sit down  at the kitchen  table  together.  It was  just  the mother,  a  
red-headed   tall  woman  who  wore  a  white  uniform;  the tather  was gone  before  I  got  up  
in  the morning  and  was
never  there at dinner  time. I only  saw  him on  weekends when  they  sometimes  sat  on  
lawn-chairs  under  the  oak tree,  each  hidden  behind  a  section  of  the  newspaper; and  
there  was  Eugene.  He  was  tall  and  blond,  and  he wore  glasses.  I  liked  him  right  away 
 because  he  sat  at
the   kitchen   table   and   read   books   for   hours.   That summer,  before  we  had  
even  spoken  one  word  to  each other,  I  kept  him company  on  my fire escape.


Once  school  started  I  looked  for  him  in  all  my classes,  but  P.  S.  1 3  was  a  huge  
place  and  it  took  me
days  and  many  discreet  questions  to  discover  Eugene. Atter  much  maneuvering  1  
managed  “to  run  into  him” in  the  hallway  where  his  locker  was—on  the  other  side ot  
the  buil ding  from  mine—and  in  study  hall  at  the library  where  he  first  seemed  to  
notice  me,  but  did  not
speak;  and  tinally,  on  the  way  home  after  school  one day  when  I  decided  to  
approach  him  directly,  though my  stomach  was doing somersaults.

I  was  ready  tor  rejection,  snobbery,  the  worst.  But when   I  came   up   to   him   and   
blurted   out:   “You’ re
Eugene.  Right?”  he  smiled,  pushed  his  glasses  up  on his  nose,  and  nodded.  I  saw  
then  that  he  was  blushing deeply.  Eugene  liked  me,  but  he  was  shy.  I  did  most  ot the 
 talking  that  day. He  nodded  and  smiled  a lot. In  the weeks  that  tollo wed,  we  w alked  
home  together.  He
would  linger  at the corner  of  El Building  for a few  min- utes  then  walk down  to his 
house.

I  did  not  tell  Eugene  that  I  coul d  see  inside  his kitchen  from  my  bedroom.  I  felt  
dishonest,  but  I  liked my  secret  sharing  of  his evenings,  especially  now  that  I
knew  what  he  was  reading  since  we  chose  our  books together  at the school 1 ibrary.

I  also  knew  my  mother  was  unhappy  in  Paterson, New  Jersey,  but  my  father  had  a  good  
job  at  the  blue- jeans  factory  in  Passaic  and  soon,  he  kept  assuring  us,
we  would  be  moving  to  our  own  house  there.  I  had learned  to  li sten  to  my  
parents'  dreams,  which  were spoken  in  Spanish,  as  fairy  tales,  like  the  stories  about 
life in  Puerto  Rico  betore  I  was  born.  I  had  been  to  the island  once  as  a  little  
girl.  We  had  not  been  back  there
since  then,  though  my  parents  talked  constantly  about buying  a  house  on  the  beach  
someday,  retiring  on  the island—that  was  a  common  topic  among  the  residents of  El  
Building.  As for  me,  I  was  going  to  go  to college and become a teacher.

         But  after  meeting  Eugene  1 began  to  think  ot  the present  more  than of  the 
future. What  I wanted  now  was to  enter  that  house  I  had  watched  for  so  many  years.  1 
wanted  to see the other  rooms  where  the old  people  had lived,  and  where  the  boy  spent  
his  time.  Most  of  all, I
wanted  to  sit  at  the  kitchen  table  with  Eugene  like  two adults,  like  the  old  man  
and  his  wite  had  done,  maybe drink some coffee and  talk about books.
