At last, Old Widow Lau was done haggling with
the driver and we stepped inside Father’s shop. It was
north-facing, quite dim inside, and perhaps this was
why Father did not see us at first. He was busy with a
customer, a man who was distinguished-looking, like
the scholars of two decades before. The two men
were bent over a glass case, discussing the different
qualities of inksticks. Big Uncle welcomed us and
invited us to be seated. From his formal tone, I knew
he did not recognize who we were. So I called his
name in a shy voice. And he squinted at me, then
laughed and announced our arrival to Little Uncle,
who apologized many times for not rushing over
sooner to greet us. They rushed us to be seated at one
of two tea tables for customers. Old Widow Lau
refused their invitation three times, exclaiming that
my father and uncles must be too busy for visitors.
She made weak efforts to leave. On the fourth
insistence, we finally sat. Then Little Uncle brought
us hot tea and sweet oranges, as well as bamboo
latticework fans with which to cool ourselves.
I tried to notice everything so I could later tell
GaoLing what I had seen, and tease out her envy. The
floors of the shop were of dark wood, polished and
clean, no dirty footprints, even though this was
during the dustiest part of the summer. And along
the walls were display cases made of wood and glass.

The glass was very shiny and not one pane was
broken. Within those glass cases were our silkwrapped boxes, all our hard work. They looked so
much nicer than they had in the ink-making studio
at Immortal Heart village.
I saw that Father had opened several of the boxes.
He set sticks and cakes and other shapes on a silk
cloth covering a glass case that served as a table on
which he and the customer leaned. First he pointed
to a stick with a top shaped like a fairy boat and said
with graceful importance, “Your writing will flow as
smoothly as a keel cutting through a glassy lake.”
He picked up a bird shape: “Your mind will soar into
the clouds of higher thought.” He waved toward a
row of ink cakes embellished with designs of peonies
and bamboo: “Your ledgers will blossom into
abundance while bamboo surrounds your quiet
mind.”
As he said this, Precious Auntie came back into
mind. I was remembering how she taught me that
everything, even ink, had a purpose and a meaning:
Good ink cannot be the quick kind, ready to pour out
of a bottle. You can never be an artist if your work
comes without effort. That is the problem of modern
ink from a bottle. You do not have to think. You
simply write what is swimming on the top of your
brain. And the top is nothing but pond scum, dead
leaves, and mosquito spawn. But when you push an
inkstick along an inkstone, you take the first step to
cleansing your mind and your heart. You push and
you ask yourself, What are my intentions? What is in
my heart that matches my mind?

I remembered this, and yet that day in the ink
shop, I listened to what Father was saying, and his
words became far more important than anything
Precious Auntie had thought. “Look here,” Father
said to his customer, and I looked. He held up an
inkstick and rotated it in the light. “See? It’s the right
hue, purple-black, not brown or gray like the cheap
brands you might find down the street. And listen to
this.” And I heard a sound as clean and pure as a
small silver bell. “The high-pitched tone tells you that
the soot is very fine, as smooth as the sliding banks of
old rivers. And the scent—can you smell the balance
of strength and delicacy, the musical notes of the
ink’s perfume? Expensive, and everyone who sees
you using it will know that it was well worth the high
price.”
I was very proud to hear Father speak of our
family’s ink this way.

Search engines have changed the way we use the
Internet, putting vast sources of information just a
few clicks away. But Harvard professor of psychology
Daniel Wegner’s recent research proves that
websites—and the Internet—are changing much
more than technology itself. They are changing the
way our memories function.
Wegner’s latest study, “Google Effects on
Memory: Cognitive Consequences of Having
Information at Our Fingertips,” shows that when
people have access to search engines, they remember
fewer facts and less information because they know
they can rely on “search” as a readily available
shortcut.
Wegner, the senior author of the study, believes
the new findings show that the Internet has become
part of a transactive memory source, a method by
which our brains compartmentalize information.
First hypothesized by Wegner in 1985, transactive
memory exists in many forms, as when a husband
relies on his wife to remember a relative’s birthday.
“[It is] this whole network of memory where you
don’t have to remember everything in the world
yourself,” he says. “You just have to remember who
knows it.” Now computers and technology as well
are becoming virtual extensions of our memory.
The idea validates habits already forming in our
daily lives. Cell phones have become the primary
location for phone numbers. GPS devices in cars
remove the need to memorize directions.
Wegner points out that we never have to stretch our
memories too far to remember the name of an
obscure movie actor or the capital of Kyrgyzstan—we
just type our questions into Google. “We become
part of the Internet in a way,” he says. “We become
part of the system and we end up trusting it.”
Working with researchers Betsy Sparrow of
Columbia University and Jenny Liu of the University
of Wisconsin–Madison, Wegner conducted four

experiments to demonstrate the phenomenon, using
various forms of memory recall to test reliance on
computers. In the first experiment, participants
demonstrated that they were more likely to think of
computer terms like “Yahoo” or “Google” after being
asked a set of difficult trivia questions. In two other
experiments, participants were asked to type a
collection of readily memorable statements, such as
“An ostrich’s eye is bigger than its brain.” Half the
subjects were told that their work would be saved to a
computer; the other half were informed that the
statements would be erased. In subsequent memory
testing, participants who were told their work would
not be saved were best at recalling the statements. In
a fourth experiment, participants typed into a
computer statements they were told would be saved
in specific folders. Next, they were asked to recall the
statements. Finally, they were given cues to the
wording and asked to name the folders where the
statements were stored. The participants proved
better able to recall the folder locations than the
statements themselves.
Wegner concedes that questions remain about
whether dependence on computers will affect
memories negatively: “Nobody knows now what the
effects are of these tools on logical thinking.”
Students who have trouble remembering distinct
facts, for example, may struggle to employ those facts
in critical thinking. But he believes that the situation
overall is beneficial, likening dependence on
computers to dependence on a mechanical hand or
other prosthetic device.
And even though we may not be taxing our
memories to recall distinct facts, we are still using
them to consider where the facts are located and how
to access them. “We still have to remember things,”
Wegner explains. “We’re just remembering a
different range of things.” He believes his study will
lead to further research into understanding computer
dependence, and looks forward to tracing the extent
of human interdependence with the computer
world—pinpointing the “movable dividing line
between us and our computers in cyber networks.”

A female guppy can be sexually mature at two
months of age and have her first babies just a month
later. This unstinting rate of reproduction makes
guppies ideally suited for studying the rate of
evolution, and David Reznick, a biologist at UC
Riverside, has been doing exactly that for the last few
decades.
People usually think of guppies as colorful
aquarium fish, but they also have a life in the real
world, inhabiting streams and rivers in tropical
places like Trinidad, where Reznick has done his
fieldwork. Guppies can experience different kinds of
conditions depending on the luck of the draw.
A lucky guppy is born above a waterfall or a set of
rapids, which keep out the predatory fish called pike
cichlids found in calmer downstream waters. As you
might expect, the guppy mortality rate—that is, the
proportion of individuals that die—is much higher in
the sites with the rapacious cichlids than in those
without them.
Reznick has shown that if you bring the fish into
the lab and let them breed there, the guppies from
the sites with many predators become sexually
mature when they are younger and smaller than do
the guppies from the predator-free sites. In addition,
the litters of baby guppies produced by mothers from
the high-risk streams are larger, but each individual
baby is smaller than those produced by their
counterparts. The disparity makes sense because if
you are at risk of being eaten, being able to have
babies sooner, and spreading your energy reserves
over a lot of them, makes it more likely that you will
manage to pass on some of your genes before you
meet your fate. Reznick and other scientists also
demonstrated that these traits are controlled by the
guppies’ genes, not by the environment in which they
grow up.
How quickly, though, could these differences in
how the two kinds of guppies lived their lives have
evolved? Because there are numerous tributaries of
the streams in Trinidad, with guppies living in some
but not all of them, Reznick realized that he could, as
he put it in a 2008 paper, “treat streams like giant test
tubes by introducing guppies or predators” to places
they had not originally occurred, and then watch as

natural selection acted on the guppies. This kind of
real-world manipulation of nature is called
“experimental evolution,” and it is growing
increasingly popular among scientists working with
organisms that reproduce quickly enough for
humans to be able to see the outcome within our
lifetimes.
Along with his students and colleagues, Reznick
removed groups of guppies from their predatorridden lives below the waterfall and released them
into previously guppy-free streams above the falls.
Although small predatory killifish occurred in these
new sites, these fish do not pose anything close to the
danger of the cichlids. Then the scientists waited for
nature to do its work, and they brought the
descendants of the transplanted fish back to the lab
to examine their reproduction. After just eleven
years, the guppies released in the new streams had
evolved to mature later, and have fewer, bigger
offspring in each litter, just like the guppies that
naturally occurred in the cichlid-free streams.
Other studies of guppies in Trinidad have shown
evolutionary change in as few as two and a half years,
or a little over four generations, with more time
required for genetic shifts in traits such as the ability
to form schools and less time for changes in the
colorful spots and stripes on a male’s body.

We are told that it is not within the “province of
woman,” to discuss the subject of slavery; that it is a
“political question,” and we are “stepping out of our
sphere,” when we take part in its discussion. It is not
true that it is merely a political question, it is likewise
a question of justice, of humanity, of morality, of
religion; a question which, while it involves
considerations of immense importance to the welfare
and prosperity of our country, enters deeply into the
home-concerns, the every-day feelings of millions of
our fellow beings. Whether the laborer shall receive
the reward of his labor, or be driven daily to
unrequited toil—whether he shall walk erect in the
dignity of conscious manhood, or be reckoned
among the beasts which perish—whether his bones
and sinews shall be his own, or another’s—whether
his child shall receive the protection of its natural
guardian, or be ranked among the live-stock of the

the master may dictate—. . . these considerations are
all involved in the question of liberty or slavery.
And is a subject comprehending interests of such
magnitude, merely a “political question,” and one in
which woman “can take no part without losing
something of the modesty and gentleness which are
her most appropriate ornaments”? May not the
“ornament of a meek and quiet spirit” exist with an
upright mind and enlightened intellect, and must
woman necessarily be less gentle because her heart is
open to the claims of humanity, or less modest
because she feels for the degradation of her enslaved
sisters, and would stretch forth her hand for their
rescue?
By the Constitution of the United States, the
whole physical power of the North is pledged for the
suppression of domestic insurrections, and should
the slaves, maddened by oppression, endeavor to
shake off the yoke of the taskmaster, the men of the
North are bound to make common cause with the
tyrant, and put down, at the point of the bayonet,
every effort on the part of the slave, for the
attainment of his freedom. And when the father,
husband, son, and brother shall have left their homes
to mingle in the unholy warfare, “to become the
executioners of their brethren, or to fall themselves

by their hands,”1 will the mother, wife, daughter, and
sister feel that they have no interest in this subject?
Will it be easy to convince them that it is no concern
of theirs, that their homes are rendered desolate, and
their habitations the abodes of wretchedness?
Surely this consideration is of itself sufficient to
arouse the slumbering energies of woman, for the
overthrow of a system which thus threatens to lay in
ruins the fabric of her domestic happiness; and she
will not be deterred from the performance of her
duty to herself, her family, and her country, by the
cry of political question.
But admitting it to be a political question, have we
no interest in the welfare of our country? May we not
permit a thought to stray beyond the narrow limits of
our own family circle, and of the present hour? May
we not breathe a sigh over the miseries of our
countrymen, nor utter a word of remonstrance
against the unjust laws that are crushing them to the
earth? Must we witness “the headlong rage or
heedless folly,” with which our nation is rushing
onward to destruction, and not seek to arrest its
downward course? Shall we silently behold the land
which we love with all the heart-warm affection of
children, rendered a hissing and a reproach
throughout the world, by this system which is already
tolling the death-bell of her decease among the
nations? No: the events of the last two years have cast
their dark shadows before, overclouding the bright
prospects of the future, and shrouding the destinies
of our country in more than midnight gloom, and we
cannot remain inactive. Our country is as dear to us
as to the proudest statesman, and the more closely
our hearts cling to “our altars and our homes,” the
more fervent are our aspirations that every
inhabitant of our land may be protected in his
fireside enjoyments by just and equal laws; that the
foot of the tyrant may no longer invade the domestic
sanctuary, nor his hand tear asunder those whom
God himself has united by the most holy ties. Let our
course, then, still be onward!

“Pathogens are acquiring resistance faster than we
can introduce new antibiotics, and this is causing a
human health crisis,” says biochemist Kim Lewis of
Northeastern University.
Lewis is part of a team that recently unveiled a
promising antibiotic, born from a new way to tap the
powers of soil microorganisms. In animal tests,
teixobactin proved effective at killing off a wide
variety of disease-causing bacteria—even those that
have developed immunity to other drugs. The
scientists’ best efforts to create mutant bacteria with
resistance to the drug failed, meaning teixobactin
could function effectively for decades before
pathogens naturally evolve resistance to it.
Natural microbial substances from soil bacteria
and fungi have been at the root of most antibiotic
drug development during the past century. But only
about one percent of these organisms can be grown
in a lab. The rest, in staggering numbers, have
remained uncultured and of limited use to medical
science, until now. “Instead of trying to figure out the
ideal conditions for each and every one of the
millions of organisms out there in the environment,
to allow them to grow in the lab, we simply grow
them in their natural environment where they
already have the conditions they need for growth,”
Lewis says.
To do this, the team designed a gadget that
sandwiches a soil sample between two membranes,
each perforated with pores that allow molecules like
nutrients to diffuse through but don’t allow the
passage of cells. “We just use it to trick the bacteria
into thinking that they are in their natural
environment,” Lewis says.
The team isolated 10,000 strains of uncultured soil
bacteria and prepared extracts from them that could
be tested against nasty pathogenic bacteria.
Teixobactin emerged as the most promising drug.

respiratory tract infections (including Staphylococcus
aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) were treated
with teixobactin, and the drug knocked out the
infections with no noticeable toxic effects.
It’s likely that teixobactin is effective because of
the way it targets disease: The drug breaks down
bacterial cell walls by attacking the lipid molecules
that the cell creates organically. Many other
antibiotics target the bacteria’s proteins, and the
genes that encode those proteins can mutate to
produce different structures.

Many good antibiotic families—penicillin,
streptomycin, tetracycline—come from soil fungi
and bacteria and it has long been suspected that, if
we could grow more types of bacteria from soil—or
from exotic environments, such as deep
oceans—then we might find new natural antibiotics.
In a recent study, researchers [Kim Lewis and others]
found that they could isolate and grow individual soil
bacteria—including types that can’t normally be
grown in the laboratory—in soil itself, which
supplied critical nutrients and minerals. Once the
bacteria reached a critical mass they could be
transferred to the lab and their cultivation continued.
This simple and elegant methodology is their most
important finding to my mind, for it opens a gateway
to cultivating a wealth of potentially antibioticproducing bacteria that have never been grown
before.
The first new antibiotic that they’ve found by this
approach, teixobactin, from a bacterium called
Eleftheria terrae, is less exciting to my mind, though
it doesn’t look bad. Teixobactin killed Gram-positive
bacteria, such as S. aureus, in the laboratory, and
cured experimental infection in mice. It also killed
the tuberculosis bacterium, which is important
because there is a real problem with resistant
tuberculosis in the developing world. It was also
difficult to select teixobactin resistance.
So, what are my caveats? Well, I see three. First,
teixobactin isn’t a potential panacea. It doesn’t kill
the Gram-negative opportunists as it is too big to
cross their complex cell wall. Secondly, scaling to
commercial manufacture will be challenging, since
the bacteria making the antibiotic are so difficult to
grow. And, thirdly, it’s early days yet. As with any
antibiotic, teixobactin now faces the long haul of
clinical trials: Phase I to see what dose you can safely
give the patient, Phase II to see if it cures infections,

CO N T I N UE
CO NTI N U E

1
and Phase III to compare its efficacy to that of
“standard of care treatment.” That’s going to take
five years and £500 million and these are numbers we
must find ways to reduce (while not compromising
safety) if we’re to keep ahead of bacteria, which can
evolve far more swiftly and cheaply.

Free Public Transportation
City planners, concerned about vehicle traffic
clogging their cities’ roadways, are trying to find ways to
get people out of their cars and onto buses and trains.
One radical proposal some planners have considered is to
make public transportation free to passengers. While
fare-free policies do increase 12 ridership, but they have
not been found to be an effective way to address traffic
problems. Moreover, these policies may result in serious
budget shortfalls.
Not surprisingly, 13 public transportation is used
by more people when people do not have to pay a fare.
According to a report by the Center for Urban
Transportation Research, public transit systems that
abolish fares typically see a short-term increase in
ridership of about 50 percent. However, this increase
does not necessarily correlate with a decrease in car
traffic. Evidence suggests that when buses and subways
are free, people often take bus and train trips they would
not have taken otherwise while still using their cars
nearly as much as they did before. In 2013 Tallinn,
Estonia, instituted fare-free rides for city residents
(becoming the largest city in the world to do so), but car
use in Tallinn has only slightly 14 declined; as a 2014
study by the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in
Sweden found that car traffic in Tallinn was down less
than 3 percent since 15 it was enacted.

devastating effect on a city’s transportation budget. All
public transportation systems are subsidized by the
government to some extent, but large systems gain a
substantial portion of their operating revenue from fares.
Since systems that go fare-free see increases in ridership,
they often must operate more buses and trains and hire
more drivers and other personnel at the same time that
they are losing a key source of funding. Advocates of
fare-free policies claim that the costs of these policies are
largely offset by various 17 savings, however, a recent
study comparing projected results of fare-free policies in

sunny. For example, in San Francisco, CA, fare-free

Wet Plate Photography: An Old Technique Makes a
New Splash
[1] Upon the arrival of the digital camera,
professional photographers harrumphed that 23 they
produced ugly, low-resolution images. [2] Yet eventually
the vast majority of them traded film for megapixels.
[3] The latest digital cameras take pictures so crisp that
the images in them appear to be die-cut. [4] Even today’s
humblest smartphones snap bright, sharp photos. [5] A
few contemporary photographers, however, have
embraced an anachronistic method that was state-ofthe-art technology when it was invented in 1851: wet
plate photography. 24

detailed, and they seem to glow with an ethereal silvery
light. One misstep or a speck of dust on the glass plate,
though, and flaws appear. Smudges resembling oyster
shells 31 swirl around the photos’ edges. Sunbursts or
streaks emerge where collodion pools unevenly. Since the
film requires long exposures, moving subjects blur. 32 A
shifting arm or leg might even disappear because of the
lengthy exposure time required. The exposure time
required explains why people in wet plate photographs
often look dour: it’s hard to hold a smile for that long.
Prominent among contemporary wet plate
photographers is Joni Sternbach, whose work centers,
appropriately, on water and people’s relationship to it.
Sternbach’s photo series Ocean Details, Sea/Sky, and
SurfLand depict surging surfs, roiling waves, and the
surfers who ride them. 33 Her subjects could be
nineteenth-century wave riders, if not for the modern
board shorts and bikinis they wear. Sternbach
characterizes wet plate photography as “one part
photography, one part performance art, and one part
three-ring circus,” a worthwhile endeavor because it
produces the unique, haunting images she seeks. “When I
look at a digital print,” she says, “it might be gorgeous
and smooth, but it’s on a piece of paper and it’s one of
many.”

Digging Up Cities
In 2010, as a construction crew began to tear up
sidewalks in New York City’s South Street Seaport to
replace a water pipe, Alyssa Loorya and her team watched
eagerly, picks and brushes in hand. Loorya, an urban
archaeologist, studies the history of 34 cities. Any New
York City construction project using municipal funds
35 are required to consider whether historical artifacts
will be affected during construction, and if that
possibility 36 exists or is possible, an urban
archaeologist must be consulted. Since the South Street
Seaport area was a bustling commercial center for early
colonists, Loorya anticipated that a rich history lay
beneath the pavement. “It’s our job to document and
recover that history before it’s lost,” she said.

faced obstacles. Fieldwork in a city has to be done
intermittently: the construction crew had to proceed one
block at a time to avoid interrupting traffic, and the
archaeology team’s work was periodically 38 halted—by
stormy weather and the discovery of toxic materials
underground. Moreover, as archaeologists underground
attempted to relay information to those at the surface,
they had to contend with the noise of construction
vehicles, car horns, and 39 pedestrians’ noise on the
busy New York City streets.

eventually began to uncover some interesting artifacts. In
2012, the team discovered a foundation wall, a network of
wooden pipes, and several well bases dating to the
eighteenth century. In August 2013, the archaeologists
discovered thousands of objects in a single fifteen-foot
stretch that was likely a garbage disposal 40 site.
Including buttons from Revolutionary War uniforms,
clay pipes, and an imported mineral water bottle from
Germany.
As they cleaned and catalogued the artifacts, the
archaeologists took stock of their findings. The team’s
discoveries provided a snapshot of 41 the various kinds
of construction materials that were used in the eighteenth
century. Colonial-era New Yorkers went to great lengths
to secure fresh drinking water, Loorya noted, given the
42 effort involved in laying wooden pipes to bring in
fresh water from surrounding areas, digging very deep
wells, brewing alcohol to mask the water’s salty taste, and
even importing bottled water.
