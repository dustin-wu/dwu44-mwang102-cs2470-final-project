Passage I

PROSE  FICTION:  This passage  is adapted  from the  title story ol  Only  the  Little  Bone,  a 
collection  of  short  stories  by  David Huddle (Oc1986 by David Huddle).

My  grandfather  has  made  crutches  for  me.  These are  sturdy  crutches,  just  the  right  
size.  I  am  delighted with them and launch myself  around the house on them.
And  take  a fall immediately.  And  continue  falling
5  several  times  a  day,  great  splatting,  knocking-into-fur- niture-and-breaking-things  falls 
 that  cause  everyone  in the  family  to  come  running.  My  grandfather  has  for- gotten  to  
put  rubber  tips  on  the  ends  of  my  crutches. When  we figure this out and buy the rubber 
tips and put
10  them  on  the  crutches,  I  stop  falling.  But  by  then  the bone-set  that  was  coming  
along  nicely  has slipped,  and the doctor  has ordered  me back to the wheelchair.

The  missing  crutch-tips  are  the first clue I have to this peculiar  family  trait,  one that 
for lack  of  any  better
15  term  I must  call  “flawed  competence.”  We  Bryants  are a family  of  able  and  clever  
people,  industrious,  intelli- gent,  determined,  and  of  good  will.  We  are  careful  in our  
work.  After  all,  my  grandfather  measured  me  on two occasions before he made the crutches. 
But we usu-
20  ally do something  wrong.

Four  years  later  I  become  increasingly  aware  of “flawed  competence”  when  I  develop  a  
plan  for  con- verting  our  old  grown-over  tennis  court  into  a  basket- ball court. My  
grandfather is always  interested  in plans,
25  and  in  this  planning  session,  we  decide  that  he  will make  the  hoops,  and  he  will  
help  me  make  the  back- boards.  Clearing  the  ground  and  smoothing  the  surface will  be  
my  tasks.  So  I rip  out  honeysuckle  and  hatchet down  a few  little  scrub  cedars.  We  
Bryants  are  known
30  for setting our minds to things.
Then  my  grandfather  delivers  the  hoops.  They  are beautifully  designed  and  constructed,  
metalwork  of  a high  order for such amateurs  as my  grandfather  and his men. But  the hoops  
are twice  as big  around  as ordinary
35  basketball  hoops.
I  s ay,   s imply,  that  they  are  too  big.  I  am  not ungrateful,  not  trying  to  be  
hateful,  not  in  my  opinion being  overly  fastidious.  I am simply  describing  a char-

                           34
acteristic  of  the  hoops.  But  my  grandfather's  feelings
40  are  damaged.  No,  they  can't  be  made  smaller,  and  no, he's  not  interested  in  
helping  me  with  the  backboards now  or  with  any  other  part  of  my  plan.  He's  sorry  he 
got  involved  in  the  first  place.  This,  too,  is  a corollary of  “flawed  competence.”  We  
are  sensitive,  especially
45  about  our  work,  especially  about  the flawed  part of  our work.

At the  place  where I work  twenty-eight  years  after the basketball  hoops, I am given  a new  
office, one with a  view  of  the  lake.  There's  a  string  attached,  though,
50  and  that  is  that  I  have  to  build  my  own  bookcases.  I commence  planning  with  
enthusiasm.  That's  another, less  harmful  family  trait,  that  attraction  to  making plans.  I 
 measure,  I look  at other  people's  shelves,  I  get someone to help me attach brackets to my 
office walls.

55           It  is   while  I  am  cutting  a  notch  in  one  of  the uprights  to  allow  access 
 to  the  light-switch  that  I  sud- denly  think  of  my  grandfather  and  those  basketball 
hoops. I feel a light sweat  break out on  my forehead.  A pattern of  genetic fate reveals itself  
to me: I’m  going to
60  mess  up  these  bookshelves  just  as  my  grandfather before  me  would  have  messed  them  
up.  No  doubt  I'm sawing the notch in the wrong  place.

The  whole  time  I  work  I  wait  to  see  where  the screw-up  is  going  to  come.  I  imagine  
what  my  col-
65  leagues  will  be  saying  about  me  in  the  hallways.  Did you  know  that Bryant  built  
his shelves so they  tilt? Did you  know  that  B ryant's  books  rejected  the  color  he painted  
his shelves?  But  the screw-up  doesn't  appear.  I paint  the shelves  red,  and  they  look  
O.K.  (Granddaddy
70  Bryant  once  painted  yellow  a  whole  row  of  company houses  he  built.)  I  paint  a  
chair  blue  and  red,  and  it's a  little  silly-looking,  but  it  picks  up  the  blue  of  the 
carpet  and  the  red  of  the  shelves.  The  vision  isn't nearly  as  impressive  as  I  thought 
 it  would  be,  but  then
75  what  vision  ever  is?  We  plan-makers  are  accustomed to  things  turning  out  
not-quite-as-good-as-we-had- in-mind.  Our  world  view  includes  the  “diminished excellence”  
component.  Diminished  excellence  is  a condition  of  the  world  and  therefore  never  an  
occasion
80  for  sorrow,  whereas  flawed  competence  comes  out  of character  and  therefore  is  
frequently  the  reason  for  the bowed  head,  the  furrowed  brow.  Three  months  later, when  I 
try  to  turn  the  heat  off  in  my  office,  I  discover that I have  placed  one of  the shelf  
uprights  too close  to

this  case  I  am  relieved  to find it. I am my grandfather's  grandson  after all.

2.  Which  of  the  following  best  describes  the  author's approach  to  presenting  the  story  
of  the  narrator's  dis- covery  about himself?
F.    Revealing  the  narrator's  self-awareness  about  a trait  through  a  blend  of  personal  
reflection  and scenes from  the narrator's  youth and adulthood

and continuing  with scenes that reveal how the discovery came about
H.   Describing  the physical  details  of  scenes  and  sum- marizing  their  significance  in  a  
concluding  state- ment in the narrator's  voice
J.     Using dialogue in the midst  of  scenes fraught  with tension  to  indicate  what  the  
narrator  is  experi- encing internally

3.  Each  of  the  three  projects  described  in  the  passage reveals:
A.   the increasing  antagonism  between  the grandfather and grandson.
B.    the  errors  the  narrator  makes  and  the  disapproval they bring from others.
C.    that  such  incidents  set  the  stage  for  the  Bryant family traits to emerge.
D.   that  the  narrator  is  determined  to  avoid  being ungrateful,  hateful,  or overly 
fastidious.

4.  The boy's approach  to the task of  converting  the tennis court to a basketball  court can 
best be described  as:
F.    reluctant until his grandfather's  plans inspire him.
G.   enthusiastic  until  his grandfather's  error  puts  them both in an awkward  position.
H.   apprehensive  until  he  discovers  his  error  is  not  a devastating  one.
J.     thrilled  until  he  remembers  that  his  grandfather  is a poor planner.

5.   As  he  is  revealed  in  the  incident  of  undertaking  the construction  of  the  
basketball  court,  the  grandfather can best be characterized  as:
A.   confidently  optimistic,  then childishly  defensive.
B.   charmingly  patient, then increasingly  accusatory.
C.   consistently  encouraging  in spite of setbacks.
D.   vocally  defensive,  then quietly  apologetic.
ACT-59F-PRACTICE                                                                                    
                                              35

6.   The  question  “Did  you  know  that  Bryant  built  his shelves  so they  tilt?”  (lines  
65-66)  helps establish  that the narrator is anxious  because:
F.    his  coworkers  have  discovered  his  incompetence and have made it the subject of office 
humor.
G.   his coworkers  resent his having  a corner office and punish him with their biting humor.
H.   he  fears  his  incompetence  is  so  glaring  it  will make him the object of ridicule among 
coworkers.
J.     the  tilting  bookshelves  remind  him  that,  like  his grandfather,  he cannot hide his 
mistakes.



7.   Information  in  the  second  paragraph  (lines  4—12) reveals  that  the  family's  response  
to  the  grandfather's error with the crutches is to:
A.   find a workable  remedy for it.
B.   lay the blame on  the narrator.
C.   praise him for more successful  projects.
D.   fix what wasn't wrong in the first place.



8.   It can most  reasonably  be inferred  from  the sixth  para- graph  (lines  36-46)  that  the  
statement  that  the  basket- ball hoops “can't be made smaller”  (line 40) is:
F.    a fact stated  by the grandfather  apologetically.
G.   an opinion stated by the grandfather indignantly.
H.   a claim the narrator  makes  to humiliate a relative.
J.     a conclusion  the narrator reaches after hard labor.


9.   It  can  most  reasonably  be  inferred  that  the  narrator's discovery  that  an  error  has 
 been  made  in  constructing the bookshelves  is for him a source of:
A.   embarrassment  in the face of coworkers  who antic- ipated it.
B.   comfort  because  it  reveals  a  trait  that  he  shares with his family.
C.   frustration  because  it  will  require  a  remedy  that will be tedious to carry out.
D.   relief  because  it  gives  him  an  excuse  to  seek  the assistance of coworkers  in 
finishing the project.



10.  In  the  last  paragraph,  a  comparison  is  made  between “diminished  excellence”  and  
“flawed  competence.” From  the  narrator's  point  of  view,  the  conditions  are different 
because  the one is:
F.    a  source  of  sorrow  while  the  other  is  a  source  of pride.
G.   based  in  the family  while  the other is  based  in  the
self.
H.   inherent  in  the  environment  while  the  other  is inherent in the individual.
J.     a  sign  that  the  individual  can  improve  the  world while the other is a sign that the 
individual can't.

Passage II

SOC IAL   SC IENC E:  T his  passag e  is  adapted  fro m  Dava Sobel's book  Longitude (Oc1995 by 
Dava Sobel).

To learn  one's  longitude  at sea, one needs  to know what  time  it  is  aboard  ship  and  also  
the  time  at  the home  port or another  place of  known  longitude—at  that very  same  moment.  
The  two  clock  times  enable  the
5  navigator  to  convert  the  hour  difference  into  a  geo- graphical  separation.  Since  the  
Earth  takes  twenty-four hours  to  complete  one  full  revolution  of  three  hundred sixty  
degrees,  one  hour  marks  one  twenty-fourth  of  a spin, or fifteen  degrees.  And  so each  
hour’ s time differ-
10  ence  between  the  ship  and  the  starting  point  marks  a progress  of  fifteen  degrees  
of  longitude  to  the  east  or west.  Every  day  at  sea,  when  the  navigator  resets  the 
ship’ s  clock  to  local  noon  when  the  sun  reache s  its highest  point  in  the  sky,  and  
then  consults  the  home-
15  port  cloc k,  every  hour’ s  discrepanc y  between  them translates  into another fifteen 
degrees of  longitude.

Those  same  fifteen  degrees  of  longitude  also  cor- respond  to  a  distance  traveled.  At  
the  Equator,  where the girth of  the Earth  is greatest,  fifteen  degrees  stretch
20  fully  one  thousand  miles.  North  or  south  of  that  line, however,  the  mileage  value  
of  each  degree  decreases. One  degree  of  longitude  equals  four  minutes  of  time the  world 
 over,  but  in  terms  of  distance,  one  degree shrinks  from  sixty-eight  miles  at  the  
Equator  to  virtu-
25  ally  nothing  at the poles.

Precise  knowledge  of  the  hour  in  two  different places  at  on ce—a  long itu de  
prerequisite  so  eas ily accessible  today  from  any  pair of  cheap  wristwatches— was  utterly  
unattainable  up  to  and  including  the  era  of
30  pendulum  clocks.  On  the  deck  of  a  rolling  ship,  such clocks  would  slow  down,  or  
speed  up,  or  stop  running altogether.  Normal  changes  in temperature  encountered en route 
from a cold country  of origin to a tropical  trade zone  thinned  or  thickened  a  clock’s  
lubricating  oil  and
35  made  its  metal  parts  expand  or  contract  with  equally disastrous  results.  A rise  or 
fall  in  barometric  pressure, or  the  subtle  variations  in  the  Earth's  gravity  from  one 
latitude  to  another,  could  also  cause  a  clock  to  gain  or lose time.

40           For  lack  of  a practical  method  of  determining  lon- gitude,  every  great  
captain  in  the  Age  of  Exploration became  lost  at sea  despite  the  best  available  charts  
and compasses.  Untold  numbers  of  sailors  died  when  their destinations  suddenly  loomed  out 
 of  the  sea  and  took
45  them  by  surprise.  In  a  single  such  accident  on  October 22,  1707, at the Scilly  Isles 
 near  the southwestern  tip of England,  nearly  two thousand  men lost their lives.

The  quest  for  a  solution  to  the  problem  of  longi- tude  persisted  over  four  centuries  
and  across  the  whole
50  continent  of   Europe.  The  B ritis h  Parliament,  in  its famed  Longitude  Act of  1 714,  
set the highest  bounty  of all,  naming  a  prize  equal  to  several  million  dollars  in 
today's  currency  for  a  “Practicable  and  Useful”  means ot determining  longitude.
ACT-59F-PRACTICE                                                                                    
                                                          36

55            English  clockmaker  John  Harrison,  a  mechanical genius  who  pioneered  the  
science  of  portable  precision timekeeping,  devoted  his  life  to  this  quest.  He  accom- pl 
is hed  wh at  Ne wton  had  fe ared  i mp os si b le:   He invented  a clock  that  would carry  
the true  time from the
60  home  port,  like  an  eternal  flame,  to  any  remote  corner of  the  world.
With  no formal  education  or apprenticeship to any watchmaker,  Harri son  nevertheless  
constructed  a  series of  virtually  friction-tree clocks  that required  no lubrica-
65  tion  and  no  cleaning,  that  were  made  from  materials impervious  to rust, and that kept 
their moving  parts per- fectly  balanced  in  relation  to one  another,  regardless  of how  the  
world  pitched  or  tossed  about  them.  He  did away  with  the  pendulum,  and  he  combined  
different
70  metals  inside  his  works  in  such  a  way  that  when  one component  expanded  or  
contracted  wi th  changes  in temperature,  the other counteracted  the change and kept the clock’ 
s rate constant.
His  every  success,  however,  was  parried  by  mem—
75  bers  of  the  scientific  elite,  who  distrusted  Harrison’ s magic  box.  The  commissioners 
 charged  with  awarding the  longitude  prize changed  the  contest  rules  whenever they  saw  
fit,  so  as  to favor  the  chances  of  astronomers over  the  likes  of  Harrison  and  his  
fellow  “mechanics.”
80  But  the utility  and  accuracy  of  Harrison’ s  approach  tri- umphed  in  the  end.  In  
1773  he  claimed  his  righttul reward.  His  followers  shepherded  Harrison’ s  intricate, 
exquisite  invention  through  the  design  modifications that enabled  it  to be mass produced  
and enjoy  wide use.

85           To  retrace  this  story  in  an  age  when  a  network  of satellites  can  nail  
down  a  ship's  position  within  a  few feet in just a moment or two—is  to see the globe anew.













11.  The  function  of  the  first  paragraph  in  relation  to  the passage  as a whole is to:
A.   orient  the  reader  to  the  subject  of  longitude  by explaining  how longitude  is 
determined  at sea.
B.   explain  the  political  significance  of  developing  an accurate way  of  determining  
longitude.
C.   establish  that  longitude  calculations  are  necessary to determine  time in  two different  
places at once.
D.   introduce a discussion  of  how knowledge  of  Earth's pos iti on  rel at i ve  to  the  Sun  
was  gained  in  the process of  advances in timekeeping.

12.  Which of  the following  best describes  the way the fifth paragraph  (lines  48-54)  
functions  in  the  passage  as  a whole?
F.    It  puts  into  historical  perspective  the  difficulty  of solving  the  longitude  problem 
 and  introduces  the subject of  Britain's longitude prize.
G.   It  translates  the  technical  terminology  used  else- where  in  the  passage  into  
language  that  is  more widely  understood.
H.   It  sheds  light  on  why  it  took  longer  for  a  solution to the longitude  problem  to 
emerge  in Europe  than in other parts of  the world.
J.     It diminishes  the importance  of  the lives that were lost in the efforts to solve the 
longitude  problem.

13.  It  can  reasonably  be  inferred  from  the  passage  that before  Harrison's  efforts,  other  
individuals  trying  to solve the longitude problem  had failed  to:
A.   consider  clocks  as  the  potential  instrument  of  cal- culation.
B.   agree  on  why  longitude  decreases  in  value  at increasing  distances from Earth's 
equator.
C.   improve  upon  the  features  of  clocks  that  made them unreliable  at sea.
D.   understand  the  ways  that  charts  and  compasses could  be  used  in  connection  with  
timepieces  to calculate longitude.

14.  The reference  to the catastrophe  at Scilly  (lines 45-47) is used to illustrate the point 
made in the passage that:
F.    charts  and  compasses  were  poorly  made  in  the 1700s.
G.   England  more  than  other  countries  stood  to  gain from a solution  to the problem  of  
determining  lon- gitude.
H.   captains  were  contributing  to  the  problem  of  lost lives  by  resisting  a  solution  to 
 the  problem  of determining  longitude.
J.     Harrison's  accomplishments  addressed  shortcom- ings  of  navigation  whose  consequences  
were  vast in scale.

15.  Information  in  the  second  paragraph  (lines  17-25) establishes  that one degree  of  
longitude  translates  into a distance of:
A.   sixty-eight  miles  at  Earth's  equator  but  less  on either side of  Earth's equator.
B.   sixty-eight  miles  at  Earth's  equator  but  more  on either side of  Earth's equator.
C.   one thousand  miles  the world over.
D.   virtually  nothing at Earth's equator, increasing  to a maximum  of sixty-eight  miles at the 
poles.

                                              37

16.  Which  of  the  following  statements  best  describes  the metals  used in Harrison's clock?
F.    The  metals  were  identical  so  that  they  would respond  consistently  to  changes  in  
conditions  at sea.
G.   The  metals  were  different  so  that  their  changes  in response  to  conditions  at  sea  
would  counteract each other.
H.   The  metals  that  remained  stable  in  response  to temperature  changes  were  encased  in  
metals  that were impervious  to rust.
J.     The  metals  expanded  and  contracted  in  ways  that were counteracted  by changes  in the 
parts made of wood.

17.  The  passage  suggests  that  Harrison's  principal  com- petitors  in  the  race  to develop  
a means  of  determining longitude  were:
A.   the great captains in the Age of  Exploration.
B.   members  of  the British Parliament.
C.    trained  clockmakers  with formal educations.
D.   individuals  in the scientific community.

18.  According  to  the  passage,  there  was  a  delay  between the  time  when  Harrison  arrived 
 at  a  solution  to  the problem  of  longitude  and  when  he received  his  reward because  his:
F.    invention  predated  the Longitude  Act of 1714.
G.   clock  was  only  one  of  many  successful  solutions to emerge simultaneously.
H.   opponents  obstructed  his efforts  to claim  the  prize money.
J.     supporters  abandoned  him  in  order  to  exploit  his invention  for their own financial 
gain.

19.  Lines  82-84  indicate  that  others  took  over  Harrison's work in order to:
A.   secure  a  wider  range  of  applications  for  an  instru- ment that had been used only at 
sea.
B.    take credit for his remarkable  accomplishments.
C.   diminish  the significance  of  his  clock  by  having  it mass-produced.
D.   turn  his  design  into  one  that  could  be  practically produced  for more users.

20.  The  passage  indicates  that  instruments  for determining longitude  now include:
F.    modified  pendulum  clocks.
G.   satellites.
H.   a network  of ships.
J.     barometers.

Passage III

HUMANITIES:  This  passag e  is  adapte d  fro m  the  ess ay “Albany,  1958”  by  Lydia  Minatoya. 
 It  appeared  in  her  book Talking  to High Monks in the Snow’ (@1992 by Lydia Minatoya). This 
story takes place in Albany, New York.

The   meter  of  my  childhood  was  the  rising  and plunging  of  a  sewing  machine  ne edle:  
rapid  and smooth,  like  an  endless  distant  drum  roll.  My  mother hummed  as  she  sewed.  
She  guided  the  fabric  this  way
5  and  that.  In  1938,  she  had  graduated  from  a  school  of costume  design,  and  before  
World  War  II,  she  had  her own  boutique  in  Los  Angeles.  It  was  a  time  when  the dream 
of  America  never seemed finer.
The  Albany  of  my  childhood  was  a  festive  place,
10  closer  in  spirit  to  the  nineteenth  century  than  to  the twenty-first.  Italian  
pushcart  grocers  crowded  southern city  blocks,  crafting  tiered  architectural  wonders  from 
fresh  produce  and  pungent  sausage.  Heavy-legged workhorses  clopped  along  cobblestones,  
delivering
15  bread  from  German  bakeries  and  milk  from  Dutch dairies. A cable car ran along streets 
named for trees.

Each  year  in  early  April,  an  annual  dinner-dance was  sponsored  by  the  pharmaceutical  
institute  where my  father  worked  as  a  researcher.  A  ballroom  was
20  rented  in  a  downtown  hotel.  Musicians  were  hired  to play  big-band  music.  The  
dinner-dance  was  the  only time when  my  mother  would  sew for herself.  It was  the one  time  
when  my  parents  went  out,  alone,  together.  I was  a  romantic  child,  dreamy  and  diffuse. 
 For  me,  the
25  dinner-dance  was an annual  event: looked forward  to in long anticipation  and back upon  
with nostalgia.

Each  year,  on  a  snowy  weekday  evening,  Father would  take  us  window  shopping.  The  
deserted  down- town streets would  be a magical glaze of  snow-softened
30  lights  and  shadowy  shop  displays.  My  mother  would linger  in  front  of  the  mannequins 
 clad  in  evening apparel. I would follow  along, drunk  with wonder.

Each  year  before  the  tape  had  desiccated  on  the backs  of  the  New  Year's  cards  and  
they  had  fallen  to
35  the floor,  my  mother  would  have  decided  on  the design for  her  dinner-dance  dress.  
Then  there  would  be  a  trip to  the  fabric  store.  I  would  run  my  hands  along  gradu- 
ated  rainbows  of  thread  spools.  I  would  watch  their changing  hues as they shimmered  in 
the light.

40           As  the dress took form,  my  parents  would  practice dancing.

“Slow,  slow,  quick,  quick,  slow,”  Father  would mutter  with  determination  as  he  trod  
unmincingly  on Okaa-chan's  feet and guided  her into the walls.

45           “Next lady?” he gallantly  would inquire.  My sister Misa  and  I  would  take  turns, 
 balancing  on  the  tops  of his shoes, as Father swept us around the room.

I always  thought  that Dinner-Dance  Eve  had  some of  the  magic  of  Christmas.  Every  year,  
I  would  perch

                                             38

50  on  the  bathtub’s  edge.  I  would  watch  my  father  fix  his tie. “See the nice dimple 
below  the knot?” Father  would turn from the mirror  and bend to show me. “The dimple is very 
important.”  I solemnly  would  nod—the  honored recipient  of  this arcane cultural  wisdom.

ss    Back  in  the  bedroom,  Okaa-chan  would  slide into her  new  dress.  She  would  glance  
at  her  reflection  with modest  pleasure.  When  she  moved,  I  could  catch  the sweet scent of 
face powder.
When  I  was  seven  or  eight,  the  window  shopping
60  and  the  dinner-dances  stopped.  The  granite  facades  of the  downtown  stores  were  grimy 
 with  graffiti.  Display windows  were  boarded  with  plywood.  The  elegant hotels  had  fallen  
into  disrepair.  No  one  danced  to  big- band music anymore.

As  I  grew  older,  my  mother  began  to  sew  for wealthy  women.  The  women  lived  in  
country  homes where  sunlight,  reflected  from  swimming  pools  just beyond  French  doors, 
played across fine wood floors.
Once  after  a  luncheon  in  the  city,  a  woman  came
70  to  our  house  for  a  fitting.  Standing  erect  in  the  door- way, then bowing slightly, my 
mother met her formally.

“Won’ t  you  please  come  in?  May  I  please  take your coat?”
“Here you  go. Try to put it somewhere  clean.”

75           Like  an  eagle,  her  words  slipped  regally  down  a great distance and struck  
with awful ease.
After the fitting, my father was ashamed and angry.

“Actually,  I  do  not  like  this  work,”  he  stormed. “You do not have to do this; we do not 
need this kind of
80  money.”  He  waved  his  arms  dismissively  at  Okaa- chan's  sewing  machine.  “They  come  
and  look  at  our home with contempt.  You kneel at their hems like a ser- vant! Mo dame desu yo/ 
It is no good, I tell you!”

Okaa-chan  was  intractable.  Eloquent  in  anger,  she 85  blazed  over  the  pronunciation  of  
words  that  ordinarily would  have  left  pondering  pauses  in  her  speech.  “I  do  not  care  
what  they  think  of  me,  of  our  home.  They cannot  affect  our  value.” My  mother  stepped  
in front  of
her  sewing  machine,  as  if  to  shield  it  from  scorn.  “My
90  work  gives  me  happiness.”   She  squarely   faced  my father.  “I   do  not  care  if   you  
speak  as  Husband,”   she said.  “I  am a Designer!”


21.  As  it  is  described  in  the  passage,  sewing  seems  most closely  associated  in  the  
narrator's  mind  with  her mother's:
A.   low wages.
B.   compassion.
C.   self-worth.
D.   thriftiness.

22.  It is  reasonable  to infer  from  the  passage  that  the nar- rator looks back on the 
dinner-dances  as a time when:
F.   her  parents  were  in  conflict  over  her  mother's work.
G.   the  entire  family  was  filled  with  excitement  and anticipation.
H.   she  and  her  father  had  a  much  easier  relationship with each other.
J.    her  mother  and  father  had  renewed  hope  for  the future of the family.

23.  It  is  reasonable  to  infer  that  the  primary  reason  the author  included  the  
information  in  the  eleventh  para- graph (lines 59—64) is to:
A.   contrast it with the earlier description  of the family looking at shop displays on a snowy 
evening.
B.   support  the information  about  the trip to the fabric store, which is presented  earlier.
C.   compare  it with  the  scene  where  the father  dances with his wife and daughters.
D.   contrast  it with  the scene presented  in the last  two paragraphs  (lines 78—92).

24.  The primary focus of lines 65-92 is:
F.   the  relationship  between  the  narrator  and  her mother.
G.   Okaa-chan's  strength and integrity.
H.   Albany's move toward  the twenty-first century.
J.    the narrator's father's stubbornness.

25.  When  the  narrator  says,  “I  solemnly  would  nod—the honored  recipient  of  this  arcane  
cultural  wisdom” (lines 53—54), she most likely means that:
A.   she felt intimidated  when her father was giving her information that she did not understand.
B.   her father was honored  to be able to share personal information  with his daughter.
C.   when  her father  put on his tie, she pretended  to be honored,  even  though  she  thought  
his  comment was silly.
D.   the information  her father  was  giving  her  seemed important  and made her feel valued.

26.  The sentence “Like an eagle, her words slipped regally down  a  great  distance  and  struck  
with  awful  ease” (lines 75—76)  indicates that the narrator:
F.    was not sure what her mother expected  of her.
G.   recognized  that her mother was being demeaned.
H.   wanted to distance herself from her mother.
J.     was ill at ease with her position in the family.

27.  Information  in  the passage  suggests  that  the narrator's father  disapproves  of  
Okaa-chan's  sewing  business primarily  because it:
A.   diminishes his role as a provider.
B.   means more to her than he does.
C.   does not generate enough income.
D.   threatens his sense of dignity.

28.  Based on  the last two  paragraphs  (lines  78-92),  which of  the  following  statements  
indicates  what  the  nar- rator's father and mother have in common?
F.   They  both want control of the family finances.
G.   They are both fighting for their self-respect.
H.   They  both want to teach a lesson to their children.
J.    They  are  both  angry  at  the  woman  who  came  for the fitting.

29.  The  author  uses  the  term  “architectural  wonders” (line 12) to describe:
A.   nineteenth-century buildings.
B.   German  baked goods.
C.   crowded city blocks with cobblestone  streets.
D.   arranged layers of fruits, vegetables,  and sausages.

30.  Which  of  the  following  words  best  describes  the  nar- rator's  father's  dancing  as  
he  practices  for  the dinner- dance with Okaa-chan?
F.    Skillful
G.   Graceful
H.   Clumsy
J.     Indifferent

Passage IV

NATURA L  SCIEN CE:  This  passag e  is  adapted  f rom  the Preface  to  neurologist  Oliver  
Sacks's  collection  of  essays  An Anthropologist on Mars (Oc1995 by Oliver Sacks).

Nature's  imagination,  as  Freeman  Dyson  likes  to say, is richer  than ours,  and  he speaks,  
mar vellingly,  of this  richness  in  the  physical  and  biological  worlds,  the endless  
diversity  of  physical  forms  and  forms  of  life.
5  For  me,  as  a  ph y s i ci an ,  nature’ s  ri ch ness  is  to  be studied  in  the  phenomena 
 of  health  and  disease,  in  the endless  forms  of  individual  adaptation  by  which  human 
organisms,  people, adapt and reconstruct  themselves.
Defects,  disorders,  diseases,  in this sense, can  play
10  a  paradoxical  role,  by  bringing  out  latent  powers, developments,  evolutions,  forms  of 
 life,  that  might never  be seen,  or even  be  imaginable,  in  their  absence. It is the  
paradox  of  disease,  in this  sense,  its  “creative” potential,  that forms  the central  theme 
of  this book.

15           Thus  while  one may  be horrified  by  the ravages  ot developmental  disorder  or  
disease,  one  may  sometimes see  them  as  creative  too—for  if  they  destroy  particular 
paths,  particular  ways  of  doing  things,  they  may  force the  nervous  system  into  making  
other  paths  and  ways,
20  force  on  it  an  unexpected  growth  and  evolution.  This other side of  development  or 
disease is something  I see, potentially,  in  almost every  patient;  and  it is this  which I am 
especially  concerned  to describe.
Similar  considerations  were  brought  up  by  A.  R.
25  Luria,  who  studied  the  long-term  survival  of  patients who  had  cerebral  tumors  or  
had  suffered  brain  injuries or strokes—and  the  way s,  the  adaptations,  they  used  to 
survive.  He  also  studied  deaf  and  blind  children  as  a very  young  man  (with  his  mentor 
 L.  S.  Vy gotsky).
30  Vygotsky  stressed  the intactness  rather  than  the deficits of such children:

A  handicapped  child  represents  a qualitatively  dif- ferent,  unique  type  of  development.... 
If  a  blind child  or  a  deaf  child  achieves  the  same  level  of
35           development  as a normal  child,  then  the child  with a  defect  achieves  this  in  
another  wa5›,  by  anc›ther course,  b» other  means,  and, for  the  pedagogue,  it is 
particularly  important  to know  the uniqueness  of the  course  along  which  he  must  lead  the 
 child.
40           This  uniqueness  transforms  the  minus  of  a  hand- icap into the plus of  
compensation.

That  such  radical  adaptations  could  occur  demanded, Luria thought,  a new  view of  the 
brain, a sense of  it not as  programmed  and  static,  but  rather  as  dynamic  and
45  active,  a supremely  efficient  adaptive system  geared  for evolution  and change,  
ceaselessly  adapting  to the needs of  the  organism—its  need,  above  all,  to  construct  a 
coherent  sell  and  world,  whatever  defects  or  disorders of  brain  function  befell  it.  
That  the  brain  is  minutely
50  differentiated  is  clear:  there  are  hundreds  of  tiny  areas crucial  for every aspect of  
perception  and behavior. The miracle  is  how  they  al1  cooperate,  are  inte grated together,  
in  the creation  of  a self.
ACT-59F-PRACTICE                                                                                    
                                                          40

This  sense  ot  the  brain’ s  remarkable  capacity  for the  most  striking  adaptations,  not  
least  in  the  special (and  often  desperate)  circumstances  of  neural  or  sen- sory  mishap,  
has  come  to  dominate  my  perception  of my  patients  and  their  lives.  So  much  so,  
indeed,  that  I am  sometime s  moved  to  wonder  whether  it  may  not  be
60  necessary  to  redefine  the  very  concepts  of  “health”  and “disease,”  to  see  these  in  
term s  of  the  ability  of  the organism  to  create  a  new  organization  and  order,  one that 
fits its special, altered  disposition  and  needs,  rather than in the terms of  a rigidly  
defined  “norm.”

65           Sickness  implies  a  contraction  of  life,  but  such contraction s  do  not  have  
to  occur.  Nearly  all  of  my patients,  so  it  seems  to  me,  whatever  their  problems, reach 
 out to life—and  not only  despite  their conditions, but often  because  of  them, and even  with 
their aid.

70           The  study  of  disease,  for  the  physician,  demands the  study  of  identity,  the 
 inner  worlds  that  patients, under  the  spur  of  illness,  create.  But  the  realities  of 
patients,  the  ways  in  which  they  and  their  brains  con- struct  their  o wn  w orl ds,   c 
an not  be  co mpr ehen ded
75  wholly  from  the  observation  of  behavior,  from  the  out- side.

With  this  in  mind,  I have  taken  off  my  white  coat, deserted,  by  and  large, the 
hospitals  where  I have spent the last twenty-five  years,  to explore  my  subjects'  lives
80  as they  live in the real world, feeling in part like a natu- ralist,  examining  rare  forms  
of  life;  in  part  like  an anthropologist, a  neuroanthropologist, in  the field—but most  of  
all  like  a  physician,  called  here  and  there  to make  house  call s,  house  c alls  at  the 
 far  borders  of
85  human  experience.






31.  The quotation  by L. S. Vygotsky  in lines 32-41 is  used in  this  passage to support  the 
idea that:
A.   children  with  handicaps  should  be  studied  in  the same  way  as  children  defined  by  
physicians  as “normal.”
B.   deficits  need  to  demonstrate  intactness  in  order  to be judged acceptable.
C.    neural  or  sensory  mishap  occurs  in  children  as well as in adults.
D.   development  of  children  with  handicaps  may  pro- ceed in positive  yet quite distinctive  
ways.

32.  The  author  of  the  passage  refers  to  the  work  of  A.  R. Luria  and  L.  S.  Vygotsky  
primarily  to  underscore  the idea that people  who have:
F.    disabilities  or  developmental  disorders  learn  to create new selves.
G.   disabilities  or  developmental  disorders  need  spe- cial  treatment.
H.   unusual handicaps  are qualitatively  different.
J.     neural  mishaps have minutely  differentiated brains.

GO ON TO THE  NEXT  PAGE.






33.  Lines 42—53 suggest that, prior to A. R. Luria's research, medical researchers  had thought of 
the brain as:
A.   dynamic.
B.    unchanging.
C.   paradoxical.
D.   creative.

34.  As  it  is  used  in  line  41,  the  word  compensation  most nearly  means:
F.    payment.
G.   differentiation.
H.   disposition.
J.     adaptation.

35.  The author's  main purpose in lines 54-69 is to show:
A.   how  he  has  come  to  think  differently  about  the brain.
B.   why sickness  often causes a contraction  of life.
C.   when  he  had  made  new  discoveries  about  the brain.
D.   which  of  his subjects  helped  him redefine  the term “norm.”

36.  The  author  of  the  passage  makes  it  clear  that,  when  it comes  to  understanding  the 
 effects  of  a  disease  on  an individual  patient,  it  is  necessary  for  medical  doctors to:
F.    adhere  to established  norms  of  human  behavior  in diagnosing and treating  disease.
G.   quickly  establish  a  method  of  treatment  that  will save the patient from further 
suffering.
H.   examine  the  ways  that  people  learn  to  live  with  a disease in their daily lives.
J.     know  each  person's  brain  is  minutely  differenti- ated and responsible for the disease 
being studied.

37.  The  last  paragraph  suggests  that  the  author's  main reason for leaving  the hospital  to 
visit his patients is to allow him to:
A.   feel more like a patient than a physician.
B.    become a more important  part of  the real world.
C.   understand his patients'  illnesses  better.
D.   see if being a naturalist  is like being a physician.

38.  The  paradox  mentioned  in  the  second  paragraph (lines 9—14) is best described  by which 
of the following statements?
F.    The  course  of  human  evolution  is  guided  by  the creative potential of  the static 
brain.
G.   Serious  illness  can  lead  directly  to  previously unthought of yet productive  
developmental  change.
H.   Sickness  may  contract  life,  but  in  so  doing  it  can maintain  the physical  “norm” at 
a similar level.
J.     The  long-term  study  of  disorders  and  diseases brings out the creative skills of 
researchers.

39.  As  it  is  used  in  line  15,  the  word  ravages  most  nearly means:
A.   paradoxical features.
B.   creative adaptations.
C.   fatal nature.
D.   destructive actions.

40.  The word miracle  in line 52 refers  most specifically  to the ways in which:
F.    brain function  disorders  are cured.
G.   unique handicaps  are compensated  for.
H.   different areas of the brain  work together.
J.     the creative potential of disease is revealed.
