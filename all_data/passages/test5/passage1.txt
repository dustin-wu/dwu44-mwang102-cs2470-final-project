Art Deco is an architectural  and decorative style that was popu- lar in the first half of the 
twentieth century.

When  you  grow  up, as I did, in a great city, during what  just  happens  to  be  its  golden  
age,  you  think  of  it as  eternal.  Always   was  there,   always   will  be.  The grandeur  of  
the  metropolis  creates  the  illusion  of  per-
manence.  The  peninsular  Bombay  into  which  I  was born  certainly  seemed  perennial  to  
me.  Malabar  and Cumballa   hills   were  our   Capitol   and  Palatine,   the Brabourne  Stadium  
was  our  Colosseum,  and  as  for  the glittering  Art  Deco  sweep  of  Marine  Drive,  well,  
that
 was  something  not  even  Rome  could  boast.  I  actually grew  up believing  Art Deco to be 
the “Bombay  style,”  a local  invention,  its  name  derived,  in  all  probability, from  the 
imperative  of  the  verb  “to see.”  Art  dekho. Lo and  behold  art.  (When  I  began  to  be  
familiar  with
images  of  New  York,  I  at  first  felt  a  sort  of  anger.  The Americans  had  so  much;  
did  they  have  to  possess  our “style”  as  well?  But  in  another,  more  secret  part  of  my 
heart,  the  Art  Deco  of  Manhattan,  built  on  a  scale  so much  grander  than  our  own,  
only  increased  America's
allure,  made  it  both  familiar  and  awe-inspiring,  our little Bombay  writ large.)

In  reality   that  Bombay   was  almost   brand-new when  I knew  it;  what's  more,  my  parents' 
 construction firm of  Merchant  & Merchant  had  been prominent  in its
making. In the ten years before my own coming into the world,  the city  had  been a gigantic  
building  site;  as if  it were  in  a  hurry  to  become,  as  if  it  knew  it  had  to  pro- 
vide  itself  in  finished  condition  by  the  time  I  was  able to start  paying  attention  to  
it  ...     No,  no,  I  don't  really
think  along  such  solipsistic  lines. I’m not over-attached to history, or Bombay.  Me, I’m  
the under-attached type.

But  let  me  confess  that,  even  as  a  child,  I  was ins ane ly  jealous  of  the  city  in  
which  I  was  raised, because it was my parents'  other love. They loved each
other  (good),  they  loved  me  (very  good),  and  they loved her (not so good). Bombay  was 
my rival. It was on  account  of  their  romance  with  the  city  that  they drew  up  that  
weekly  rota  (list)  of  shared  parental responsibilities. When  my  mother  wasn't  with  me—
when I was riding on my father's shoulders, or staring,

with  him,  at  the  fish  in  the  Taraporewala  Aquarium— she  was  out  there  with  her,  with  
Bombay;  out  there bringing  her  into  being.  (For  of  course  construction work  never  stops  
completely,  and  supervising  such
work  was  Ameer's  particular  genius.  My  mother  the master  builder.  Like  her  father  
before  her.)  And  when my  father  handed  me  over  to  her,  he  went  off,  wearing his  
local-history  hat  and  a  khaki  jacket  full  of  pockets, to dig in  the foundations  of  
building sites for the secrets
of  the  city's  past,  or  else  sat  hatless  and  coatless  at  a designing  board and 
dreamed  his lo-and-behold  dreams.

Maps  of  the  early  town  afforded  my  father  great joy,  and  his  collection  of  old  
photographs  of  the  edi- fices  and  ob jets  of  the  vanished  city  was  second  to
none.   In   these   faded   images   were   resurrected   the demolished  Fort,  the  
“breakfast  bazaar”  market  outside the Teen Dar vaza or Bazaargate,  and the humble mutton shops  
and  umbrella  hospitals  of  the  poor,  as  well  as the fallen  palaces  of  the  great.  The 
early  city's  relics  filled
his  imagination  as  well  as  his  photo  albums.  It  was from  my  father  that  I  learned 
 of  Bombay’s  first  great photographers,  Raja  Deen  Dayal  and  A.  R.  Haseler, whose  
portraits  of  the  city  became  my  first  artistic influences,  if  only  by  showing  me  what  
I  did  not  want
to  do.  Dayal  climbed  the  Rajabai  tower  to  create  his sweeping  panoramas  of  the  
birth  of  the  city;  Haseler went  one  better  and  took  to  the  air.  Their  images  were 
awe-inspiring,  unforgettable,  but  they  also  inspired  in me  a  desperate  need  to  get  back 
 down  to  ground  level.
From  the  heights  you  see  only  pinnacles.  I  yearned  for the  city  streets,  the  knife 
 grinders,  the  water  carriers, the  pavement  moneylenders,  the  peremptory  soldiers, the 
railway  hordes,  the chess players in the Irani restau- rants,  the  snake-buckled  
schoolchildren,  the  beggars,
the  fishermen,  the  moviemakers,  the  dockers,  the  book sewers,  the  loom  operators,  
the  priests.  I  yearned  for life.

When  I  said   this  to  my  father   he  showed   me photos,  still lives  of  storelronts  and  
piers,  and  told  me I
was  too  young  to  understand.  “See  where  people  lived and worked and shopped,”  he 
clarified,  with a rare flash of  irritation,  “and  it  becomes  plain  what  they  were like.”  
For  all  his  digging,  Vivvy  Merchant  was  content with  the  surfaces  of  his  world.  I,  
his  photographer  son,
set  out  to  prove  him  wrong,  to  show  that  a  camera  can see  beyond  the  surface,  
beyond  the  trappings  of  the actual, and penetrate to its flesh and heart.
