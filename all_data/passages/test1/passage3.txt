The   meter  of  my  childhood  was  the  rising  and plunging  of  a  sewing  machine  ne edle:  
rapid  and smooth,  like  an  endless  distant  drum  roll.  My  mother hummed  as  she  sewed.  
She  guided  the  fabric  this  way
and  that.  In  1938,  she  had  graduated  from  a  school  of costume  design,  and  before  
World  War  II,  she  had  her own  boutique  in  Los  Angeles.  It  was  a  time  when  the dream 
of  America  never seemed finer.
The  Albany  of  my  childhood  was  a  festive  place,
closer  in  spirit  to  the  nineteenth  century  than  to  the twenty-first.  Italian  
pushcart  grocers  crowded  southern city  blocks,  crafting  tiered  architectural  wonders  from 
fresh  produce  and  pungent  sausage.  Heavy-legged workhorses  clopped  along  cobblestones,  
delivering
bread  from  German  bakeries  and  milk  from  Dutch dairies. A cable car ran along streets 
named for trees.

Each  year  in  early  April,  an  annual  dinner-dance was  sponsored  by  the  pharmaceutical  
institute  where my  father  worked  as  a  researcher.  A  ballroom  was
rented  in  a  downtown  hotel.  Musicians  were  hired  to play  big-band  music.  The  
dinner-dance  was  the  only time when  my  mother  would  sew for herself.  It was  the one  time  
when  my  parents  went  out,  alone,  together.  I was  a  romantic  child,  dreamy  and  diffuse. 
 For  me,  the
dinner-dance  was an annual  event: looked forward  to in long anticipation  and back upon  
with nostalgia.

Each  year,  on  a  snowy  weekday  evening,  Father would  take  us  window  shopping.  The  
deserted  down- town streets would  be a magical glaze of  snow-softened
lights  and  shadowy  shop  displays.  My  mother  would linger  in  front  of  the  mannequins 
 clad  in  evening apparel. I would follow  along, drunk  with wonder.

Each  year  before  the  tape  had  desiccated  on  the backs  of  the  New  Year's  cards  and  
they  had  fallen  to
the floor,  my  mother  would  have  decided  on  the design for  her  dinner-dance  dress.  
Then  there  would  be  a  trip to  the  fabric  store.  I  would  run  my  hands  along  gradu- 
ated  rainbows  of  thread  spools.  I  would  watch  their changing  hues as they shimmered  in 
the light.

         As  the dress took form,  my  parents  would  practice dancing.

“Slow,  slow,  quick,  quick,  slow,”  Father  would mutter  with  determination  as  he  trod  
unmincingly  on Okaa-chan's  feet and guided  her into the walls.

         “Next lady?” he gallantly  would inquire.  My sister Misa  and  I  would  take  turns, 
 balancing  on  the  tops  of his shoes, as Father swept us around the room.

I always  thought  that Dinner-Dance  Eve  had  some of  the  magic  of  Christmas.  Every  year,  
I  would  perch

on  the  bathtub’s  edge.  I  would  watch  my  father  fix  his tie. “See the nice dimple 
below  the knot?” Father  would turn from the mirror  and bend to show me. “The dimple is very 
important.”  I solemnly  would  nod—the  honored recipient  of  this arcane cultural  wisdom.

ss    Back  in  the  bedroom,  Okaa-chan  would  slide into her  new  dress.  She  would  glance  
at  her  reflection  with modest  pleasure.  When  she  moved,  I  could  catch  the sweet scent of 
face powder.
When  I  was  seven  or  eight,  the  window  shopping
and  the  dinner-dances  stopped.  The  granite  facades  of the  downtown  stores  were  grimy 
 with  graffiti.  Display windows  were  boarded  with  plywood.  The  elegant hotels  had  fallen  
into  disrepair.  No  one  danced  to  big- band music anymore.

As  I  grew  older,  my  mother  began  to  sew  for wealthy  women.  The  women  lived  in  
country  homes where  sunlight,  reflected  from  swimming  pools  just beyond  French  doors, 
played across fine wood floors.
Once  after  a  luncheon  in  the  city,  a  woman  came
to  our  house  for  a  fitting.  Standing  erect  in  the  door- way, then bowing slightly, my 
mother met her formally.

“Won’ t  you  please  come  in?  May  I  please  take your coat?”
“Here you  go. Try to put it somewhere  clean.”

         Like  an  eagle,  her  words  slipped  regally  down  a great distance and struck  
with awful ease.
After the fitting, my father was ashamed and angry.

“Actually,  I  do  not  like  this  work,”  he  stormed. “You do not have to do this; we do not 
need this kind of
money.”  He  waved  his  arms  dismissively  at  Okaa- chan's  sewing  machine.  “They  come  
and  look  at  our home with contempt.  You kneel at their hems like a ser- vant! Mo dame desu yo/ 
It is no good, I tell you!”

Okaa-chan  was  intractable.  Eloquent  in  anger,  she 85  blazed  over  the  pronunciation  of  
words  that  ordinarily would  have  left  pondering  pauses  in  her  speech.  “I  do  not  care  
what  they  think  of  me,  of  our  home.  They cannot  affect  our  value.” My  mother  stepped  
in front  of
her  sewing  machine,  as  if  to  shield  it  from  scorn.  “My
work  gives  me  happiness.”   She  squarely   faced  my father.  “I   do  not  care  if   you  
speak  as  Husband,”   she said.  “I  am a Designer!”
