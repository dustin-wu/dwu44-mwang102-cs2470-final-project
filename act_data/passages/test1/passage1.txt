My  grandfather  has  made  crutches  for  me.  These are  sturdy  crutches,  just  the  right  
size.  I  am  delighted with them and launch myself  around the house on them.
And  take  a fall immediately.  And  continue  falling
several  times  a  day,  great  splatting,  knocking into furniture and breaking things  falls 
 that  cause  everyone  in the  family  to  come  running.  My  grandfather  has  for- gotten  to  
put  rubber  tips  on  the  ends  of  my  crutches. When  we figure this out and buy the rubber 
tips and put
them  on  the  crutches,  I  stop  falling.  But  by  then  the bone-set  that  was  coming  
along  nicely  has slipped,  and the doctor  has ordered  me back to the wheelchair.

The  missing  crutch-tips  are  the first clue I have to this peculiar  family  trait,  one that 
for lack  of  any  better
term  I must  call  “flawed  competence.”  We  Bryants  are a family  of  able  and  clever  
people,  industrious,  intelli- gent,  determined,  and  of  good  will.  We  are  careful  in our  
work.  After  all,  my  grandfather  measured  me  on two occasions before he made the crutches. 
But we usually do something  wrong.

Four  years  later  I  become  increasingly  aware  of “flawed  competence”  when  I  develop  a  
plan  for  con- verting  our  old  grown-over  tennis  court  into  a  basket- ball court. My  
grandfather is always  interested  in plans,
and  in  this  planning  session,  we  decide  that  he  will make  the  hoops,  and  he  will  
help  me  make  the  back- boards.  Clearing  the  ground  and  smoothing  the  surface will  be  
my  tasks.  So  I rip  out  honeysuckle  and  hatchet down  a few  little  scrub  cedars.  We  
Bryants  are  known
for setting our minds to things.
Then  my  grandfather  delivers  the  hoops.  They  are beautifully  designed  and  constructed,  
metalwork  of  a high  order for such amateurs  as my  grandfather  and his men. But  the hoops  
are twice  as big  around  as ordinary
basketball  hoops.
I  say,   simply,  that  they  are  too  big.  I  am  not ungrateful,  not  trying  to  be  
hateful,  not  in  my  opinion being  overly  fastidious.  I am simply  describing  a 

characteristic  of  the  hoops.  But  my  grandfather's  feelings
are  damaged.  No,  they  can't  be  made  smaller,  and  no, he's  not  interested  in  
helping  me  with  the  backboards now  or  with  any  other  part  of  my  plan.  He's  sorry  he 
got  involved  in  the  first  place.  This,  too,  is  a corollary of  “flawed  competence.”  We  
are  sensitive,  especially
about  our  work,  especially  about  the flawed  part of  our work.

At the  place  where I work  twenty-eight  years  after the basketball  hoops, I am given  a new  
office, one with a  view  of  the  lake.  There's  a  string  attached,  though,
and  that  is  that  I  have  to  build  my  own  bookcases.  I commence  planning  with  
enthusiasm.  That's  another, less  harmful  family  trait,  that  attraction  to  making plans.  I 
 measure,  I look  at other  people's  shelves,  I  get someone to help me attach brackets to my 
office walls.

It  is   while  I  am  cutting  a  notch  in  one  of  the uprights  to  allow  access 
 to  the  light-switch  that  I  sud- denly  think  of  my  grandfather  and  those  basketball 
hoops. I feel a light sweat  break out on  my forehead.  A pattern of  genetic fate reveals itself  
to me: I’m  going to
mess  up  these  bookshelves  just  as  my  grandfather before  me  would  have  messed  them  
up.  No  doubt  I'm sawing the notch in the wrong  place.

The  whole  time  I  work  I  wait  to  see  where  the screw-up  is  going  to  come.  I  imagine  
what  my  col-
leagues  will  be  saying  about  me  in  the  hallways.  Did you  know  that Bryant  built  
his shelves so they  tilt? Did you  know  that  B ryant's  books  rejected  the  color  he painted  
his shelves?  But  the screw-up  doesn't  appear.  I paint  the shelves  red,  and  they  look  
O.K.  (Granddaddy
Bryant  once  painted  yellow  a  whole  row  of  company houses  he  built.)  I  paint  a  
chair  blue  and  red,  and  it's a  little  silly-looking,  but  it  picks  up  the  blue  of  the 
carpet  and  the  red  of  the  shelves.  The  vision  isn't nearly  as  impressive  as  I  thought 
 it  would  be,  but  then
what  vision  ever  is?  We  plan-makers  are  accustomed to  things  turning  out  
not quite as good as we had in-mind.  Our  world  view  includes  the  “diminished excellence”  
component.  Diminished  excellence  is  a condition  of  the  world  and  therefore  never  an  
occasion
for  sorrow,  whereas  flawed  competence  comes  out  of character  and  therefore  is  
frequently  the  reason  for  the bowed  head,  the  furrowed  brow.  Three  months  later, when  I 
try  to  turn  the  heat  off  in  my  office,  I  discover that I have  placed  one of  the shelf  
uprights  too close  to

the radiator  to be  able  to  work  the valve. The screw-up was  there  all  along,  but  in  
this  case  I  am  relieved  to find it. I am my grandfather's  grandson  after all.
