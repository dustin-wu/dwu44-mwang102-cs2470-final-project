D.   The  magnitude  of  wild  apples  in  Kazakhstan  is stunning.

GO ON TO THE  NEXT PAGE.






12.  The  author  of  Pass age  A  most  likely  states  that  the wild  apples  growing  in  the  
Tian  Shan  looked  like apples  found  at  the  local  grocery  store  to  support  the point 
that:
F.    many  of  the  apples  stocked  in  grocery  stores  are harvested in the Tian Shan.
G.   in  the Tian Shan, Vavilov had likely found the wild ancestors  of  the domesticated  apple.
H.   the  wild  apples  growing   in  the  Tian  Shan  are among  the most popular  varieties  with 
consumers.
J.     in  the  Tian  Shan,  Vavilov  had  found  new  apple varieties to introduce to food 
producers.
13.  Passage A  makes  which  of  the  following  claims  about plant species  that are found in  
Kazakhstan?
A.   Approximately  157 species  of  cultivated  temperate fruits originated  in Kazakhstan.
B.    Ninety  percent  of  all domesticated  crops  are either direct  precursors  or  close  wild  
relatives  of  plant species found in Kazakhstan.
C.    Ol  the  plant  species  found  in  Kazakhstan,  ninety percent  are species of  apples.
D.   Aside from apples, at least 157 plant species found in  Kazakhstan  are either  direct  
precursors  or close wild relatives of  domesticated  crops.

14.  Passage  B  most  strongly  suggests  that  Vavilov  was motivated  to become  an  
agricultural  scientist  primarily because  he:
F.    wanted  to have one of his findings  published.
G.   aimed to work  with a famous  botanist.
H.   wished  to remedy  a personal  financial  crisis.
J.     hoped to help feed others.

15.  The  author   of   Passage  B   uses  the   phrase   “whittle away”  (line 80)  to  refer  to  
the  way  that  apple  varieties have been:
A.   gradually   lost  from   nursery  catalogs,  farmers' markets,  and the American  table.
B.   modified  by  plant  breeders,  entomolo g ists,  and pathologists  to meet specialized  
needs.
C.    weeded  out  by  scientists  until  only  the  few  thou- sand  most resilient  varieties 
remained.
D.   pared  down  in  1904  to the  few  varieties  that  nurs- ery catalogs  wanted  to feature.

16.  As it is used in lines 82-83, the phrase named  and  nur- tured  most nearly  means:
F.    nominated  and encouraged.
G.   identified  and cultivated.
H.   pointed  to and groomed.
J.     cited  and fed.

                                                  35

17.   In  Passage B,  it  can  most  reasonably  be  inferred  from the  third  paragraph  (lines  
74-79)  that  “centers  of  crop diversity”  become crucially  important  when:
A.   plant  breeders  would  like  to  learn  more  about  the plant species of central  Asia.
B.    problems  with  a  cultivated  crop  require  experts  to research  a new variety  of  the 
crop.
C.   consumers  would  like more  variety  in grocery  pro- duce departments.
D.   disputes  among  plant  breeders,  pathologists,  and entomologists  lead to a reduction  in 
crop variety.



18.  Which  of  the  following  statements  best  describes  the difference in the tone of  the two 
passages?
F.    Passage  A   is   defensive,   whereas   Passage  B   is dispassionate.
G.   Passage  A   is    solemn,    whereas    Passage  B   is optimistic.
H.   Passage  A  is  celebratory,   whereas  Passage  B  is cautionary.
J.     Passage  A  is  accusatory,   whereas  Passage  B  is sentimental.



19.  Compared  to  the  author  of  Passage  A,  the  author  of Passage B provides more 
information  about the:
A.   reduction  in the number  of  apple varieties  in North America over the past four centuries.
B.   methods  Vavilov  used  to  prove  to  other  scientists that  the  apples  growing  in  the  
Tian  Shan  are  the ancestors  of  the modern  apple.
C.    number   of   apple   varieties   that   are  thriving   in Kazakhstan  today.
D.   techniques  used  by  researchers  to  determine  the regions   with   the   greatest   
genetic   diversity   in plants.



20.  Passage A quotes  Vavilov  as  saying  “‘I  could  see  with my  own  eyes  that  I  had  
stumbled  upon  the  centre  of origin  for  the  apple”’  (lines  l 1—12).  In  Passage B  this 
quote is directly:
F.    invoked  by  the passage  author  as he imagines  what Kazakhstan  looked  like centuries 
ago.
G.   used  to support  an argument  by  USDA scientists.

Passage III

HUMANITIES:  This  passage  is  adapted  from  the  article  “The Quiet  Sideman”  by  Colin  
Fleming  (02008  by  The  American Scholar).

Near  the  end  of  his  eight  years  as  a  recording- session  musician,  tenor  saxophonist  
Leon  “Chu”  Berry landed  a  short-lived  spot  with  Count  Basie's  orchestra. Standing  in  for 
 one  of  the  Basie  band’s  two  tenor
5  giants,  Berry  took  a  lead  solo on  “Oh,  Lady  Be  Good,” the  1924  Gershwin  song  that  
B asie  had  played  for years.   In   the   28   seconds   that   the   solo   lasted   on 
February  4,  1939,  we  are  treated  to  no  less  than  the musical  personification  of   mind  
and  body   working
10  together  in divine tandem. When you  hear the recording for  the  first  time,  you're  likely 
 to  wonder  why  you've never heard of  Chu Berry  before.

Why  you've  never  heard  of  him is  pretty  simple:  a lot of  hard-core  jazz  buffs don’t know 
 much  about  him.
15  Berry   was  a  solid  session   player   who  turns   up  on recordings     with    Basie,    
Bessie    Smith,    Fletcher Henderson,  and Billie  Holiday.  But he did  not cut many sessions  
himself  as  a  leader,  and  when  he  soloed,  he worked  within  the  recording  constraints  of 
 the  era  and
20  the swing genre—fast-moving 78s with solos often last- ing for a mere 32 beats.

The  people  who  loved  Berry  were,  not  surpris- ingly,  other  tenor  players,  a  situation  
leading  to  the dreaded   “musician's   musician”   tag.   But   that's   not
25  nearly  praise enough  to describe  Chu  Berry,  who,  when given  opportunity,  displayed  a  
musical  dexterity  that would  be envied  by future generations  of  horn  men.

Berry faced  the lot of  other horn players: having to grind  it  out  long  and  hard  until  
something  memorable
30  burst  through;  the  prejudices  and  expectations  of  the listening  public;  and  the  
accepted  wisdom  of  what  is and  isn’I art in  a given  medium.  In  this case, swing  was 
fodder for dance parties,  not music  worthy of  study.
Oddly   enough,   Berry's   geniality    might   help
35  explain  his  failure  to  court  history's  favor:  it  wasn’t  in his  nature  to  call  
attention  to  himself   or  his  playing. Born  in  1908  into  the  black  middle  class  in  
Wheeling, West  Virginia,  the  laid-back,  affable  Berry  attended West  Virginia  State  in  
Charleston,  where  he  switched
40  from  alto  sax  to  tenor  and  exhibited  the  willingness  to fit  in  that  characterized  
his  presence  in  so  many  dance bands.  He  was  the  rare  artist  who  refused  to  put  his 
interests  above  those  of  the  band,  even  if  that  meant playing  ensemble  passages  rather  
than  taking  a  healthy
45  allotment of solo breaks.
College  proved  a  training  ground  for  Berry  the bandsman,  as  he  teamed  up  with  a  
number  of  amateur outfits.  He never  played  simply  to show  off. Instead,  he tried  to bring 
out the positive  attributes  in any given sit-
50  uation  or setting.  Later,  when  Berry  is  performing  with the  Calloway  ensemble,  we  
hear  some  ragged,  out-of- tune  playing  until  Berry’s  first  few  solo  notes  emerge.
ACT-1874FPRE                                                                                        
                                                  36

The  other  players,  no longer  languidly  blowing  through their  charts,  immediately   surge  
up  behind   him,  all
55  fighting-fit.  Once  Berry  finishes  his  solo,  the  shenani- gans resume.

After making his way  to New  York, Berry  immedi- ately  became  a  presence  and  soon  was  in  
demand.  The great  jazz  orchestras  of  the  swing  era  were  fronted  by
60  musical  directors/arrangers—Duke  Ellington  was  pre- eminent—who  drew  the  acclaim.  The  
sidemen  were musical  traveling  s alesmen  who  sold  someone  else's wares  in  the  best  style 
 they  could  manage.  It  was  with Fletcher  Henderson  that  Berry  began  to  ditch  some  of
65  the   sideman's   subservient   trappings.   For   starters, Henderson  wrote  in  keys  that  
were  rare  for  the  jazz orchestras  of  the  day,  and  his  somber,  indigo-infected voicings  
were ideal for a player of  Berry’s introspective approach  to  his  instrument:  Berry  sounds  as 
 if  he's
70  being  swallowed  by  his  sax.  “Blues  in  C Sharp  Minor,” for  instance,  is  odd,  
haunting,  and  ultimately  relaxing. A  Berry  solo  in  it  is  slightly  off  mike,  making  the 
 lis- tener  feel  as  though  he's  been  playing  for  some  time before  we  finally  hear  him. 
 The  effect  is  unnerving,  as
75  if  we weren't  paying close attention.

In June 1940, Cab Calloway  granted  Berry a show- case  piece,  “A  Ghost  of  a  Chance,”  the  
sole  recording in  Berry's  career  to  feature  him  from  start  to  finish.  It was   his   
“Body   and   Sou1,”   a   response   to  Coleman
80  Hawkins’s  famous  recording,  intended  not  as  a  riposte to a  rival,  but  as  the other  
half  of  a dialogue.  Its  rubato lines  are  disembodied  from  the  music  meant  to accom- pany 
 it,  which  is  spartan  to  begin  with.  This  may  be Berry's   one  and   only   instance   of 
  indulgence   on   a
85  record,  a  cathedral  of  a  solo  in  its  flourishes,  angles, ornamentations,  reflexivity. 
  If   sunlight   could   pass through  music,  “A  Ghost  of  a Chance”  would  funnel  it out in 
the broadest  spectrum  of  colors.









21.  Based  on  the  passage,  how  did  Berry's  personality affect his career?
A.   His  ambitious,  competitive  personality  was  off- putting  to  other  musicians,  who  were 
 reluctant  to play  with him.
B.   His genial personality  endeared  him to other  musi- cians,  but  his  career  suffered  when 
 he  spent  more time socializing  than practicing.
C.   His  modest  and  eas ygoing  personality  kept  him out of  the spotlight  and, consequently, 
 he received less attention  as a performer.
D.   His  shy,  introspective  personality  was  misunder- stood  as  snobbish  arrogance,  so  he  
was  offered few recording-session jobs.

22.  The  author  mentions  Berry’s  solo  in  “Oh,  Lady  Be Good” primarily  in order to:
F.    illustrate  why most people haven't  heard of  Berry.
G.   provide an example  of  Berry's  musical excellence.
H.   contrast   Berry's  later   work   with  Berry’s  early work.
J.     establish  that  Berry’s  solo  was  better  than  Count Basie's.


23.  The  author  points  out  that  many  serious  jazz  enthusi- asts know  little about Berry  
primarily  in order to:
A.   criticize  scholarship  that  has  provided  an  unbal- anced history  of  jazz.
B.   demonstrate  that the author is more knowledgeable than  most jazz scholars.
C.   illustrate  the  secrecy  Berry  demanded  in  order  to preserve his family's privacy.
D.   explain  why  it's likely  that  readers  would  be unf'a- miliar  with Berry.


24.  According  to  the  author,  Berry’s  solos  as  a  recording- session  musician  were often 
very short  because  he:
F.    wasn't  a  very  good  saxophone  player  until  late  in his career.
G.   drew  more attention  playing ensemble passages.
H.   worked  within  the recording constraints  of  the era.
J.     preferred  play ing  many  short  solos  to  play ing  a few long ones.


25.  The  author  indicates  that  during  Berry's  time  as  a musician, swing music  was 
primarily  regarded  as:
A.   an opportunity  for soloists to show  off  their skills.
B.   a genre to be most appreciated  by young  people.
C.    musician's  music that lacked a popular  audience.
D.   music for dance parties but  not music for study.

26.  As  it  is  used  in  line  35,  the  word  court  most  nearly means  to:
F.    seek  to attract.
G.   romantically  pursue.
H.   dangerously  provoke.
J.     pass judgment  upon.

27.  In  the  seventh  paragraph  (lines  57-75),  the  author compares  sidemen  to traveling  
salesmen  in order to:
A.   make clear how often musicians  had to travel.
B.   indicate  that  musicians  often had side jobs.
C.   illustrate  sidemen's  supportive  role in a band.

H.   artful, sublime,  and  unexpectedly  upbeat.
J.     odd, haunting,  and relaxing.

29.  According  to the author,  what  is unique  about  the June 1940 rendition of  the song “A 
Ghost of  a Chance”?
A.   It's  the  only  recorded  piece  that  features  Berry from beginning  to end.
B.   Berry  plays  an  alto saxophone  instead  of  his  usual tenor  saxophone.
C.   It  was  the  only  public  performance  Berry  gave  in 1940.
D.   Berry  showcases  his  unrivaled  ability  to  play  a solo that blends into the background.

30.  The  author  uses  the  phrase  “a  cathedral  of  a  solo” (line 85) most  likely  to create  
a sense that Berry's  solo was:
F.    an intricate,  awe-inspiring  masterpiece.
G.   a somber,  mournful  hymn.
H.   a crumbling  remnant of’ Berry's once-great  skill.
J.     a testament  to Calloway's  band leadership.

B.   The gravitational  tidal forces of  the Milky  Way are destroying  the Sagittarius  Dwarf.
C.    Most  astronomers  have  come  to an  agreement  that evidence  about  how  galaxies  have  
formed  is,  at best, circumstantial.
D.   Evidence   suggests   that   the  warp  in  the  Milky Way's  disk  results  from  the  Milky  
Way's  interac- tion with a small satellite galaxy.

32.  It  can  reasonably   be  inferred  that  the  problem  the author  mentions  in line 33 
refers to:
F.    a  particular  aspect  of  B ailin’s  theory  for  which there is little evidence.
G.   a  mathematical   computation   that  led  B ailin   to focus on the Sagittarius Dwarf.
H.   the  question  of  which  physical  processes  caused the warp in the Milky  Way.
J.     the  potential  impact  of  wobbly  gyrations  on  the Milky  Way’s rotation.

H.    It  revealed  problems  with  the  basic  assumptions held by  most astronomers.
J.     It provided  evidence  for an  idea  that  scientists  had long   considered   a  
possibility   but   had   not   yet proved.

35.  According  to  the  passage,  Bailin  discovered  that  the angular  momentum  of  the warped  
portion  of  the Milky Way  and  the  angular  momentum  of  the  Sagittarius Dwarf  are:
A.   identical in quantity  but different  in direction.
B.   identical  in direction  but different  in quantity.
C.   identical in both quantity  and  direction.
D.   different  in both quantity and direction.

36.  According  to  the  passage,  the  central  bulge  of  the Milky  Way  is comprised  of:
F.    80 percent of  the galaxy’s  stars.
G.   older stars and a black hole.
H.   a galactic  plane and several  dwarf  planets.
J.     a loose agglomeration  of  unidentified  matter.

37.  The author  refers  to  the swirling  pattern  of  a hurricane primarily  in order to:
A.   help  explain  the  shortcomings  of  the  plum-and- pizza metaphor.
B.    argue  that  the  unpredictability  of  the  rotation  of spiral galaxies requires  a new  
metaphor.
C.   emphasize  the particular  aspects  of  the Milky  Way that make it unique.
D.   describe  how  the movement  of  the Milky  Way  cre- ates gravitational  tides.

38.  The passage directly  compares the Milky  Way’s disk as it is affected  by its warp to:
F.    a pasta  maker  churning out spaghetti.
G.   pizza dough  being  spun in the air by a chef.
H.   a thin-crust  pizza balanced on top of  a plum.
J.     two figure  skaters  coming  together  for  a  combina- tion spin.

39.  According  to the passage, which of the following  state- ments  best  describes  the  
movement  of  the  Sagittarius Dwarf  with respect  to the Milky  Way?
A.   It appears  to be in a roughly  polar orbit around  the Milky  Way.
B.   It  appears  to  orbit  the  Milky  Way  at  an  angle  of roughly forty-five  degrees.
C.   It  follows  the  movement  of  the  stars  in  the  Milky Way's disk,  though  at a slightly  
faster  rate.
D.   It  once  followed  the  movement  of  the  stars  in  the Milky  Way's  disk,  but  now  
seems  to  move  errati- cally  along its own path.

40.  The   passage   describes   angular   momentum   as   the amount of  a system's:
F.    vertical deviation  within an orbital path.
G.   movement in a straight  line through  space.
H.   gravitational  pull.
J.     spin or rotation.
