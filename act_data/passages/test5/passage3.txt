I began  to learn  the nature  of  surprises,  thankfully, when  I  was  fairly  young  as  a  
writer.  Before  that,  like every  beginner,  I thought  you  could  beat,  pummel,  and thrash  
an  idea  into  existence.  Under  such  treatment,  Of
course,  any  decent  idea  folds  up  its  paws,  turns  on  its
back, fixes its eyes on eternity,  and dies.

It  was  with  great  relief,  then,  that  in  my  early twenties I floundered into a 
word-association process  in which  I simply  got  out  of  bed  each  morning,  walked  to
 my desk, and  put down any  word or series of  words that happened  along in  my head.

I  would  then  take  arms  against  the  word,  or for  it, and  bring  on  an  assortment  of  
characters  to  weigh  the word  and show  me its meaning  in my own  life. An hour
or  two  hours  later,  to  my  amazement,   a  new  story would  be finished  and  done. The  
surprise  was  total  and lovely.  I soon found  that I would  have to  work  this  way for the 
rest of  my life.
First  I  rummaged  my  mind  for  words  that  could
describe  my  personal  nightmares,  fears  of  night  and time from my childhood,  and shaped  
stories from  these.

Then  I  took  a  long  look  at  the  green  apple  trees and the old house I was born in and the 
house  next door where  lived  my  grandparents,  and  all  the  lawns  of  the
summers  I  grew  up  in,  and  I  began  to  try  words  for  all that.

was startled  when  truths leaped  out of  bushes  like quail before  gunshot.  I  blundered  into 
creativity  as  any  child
learning  to  walk  and  see. I learned  to let my  senses  and my  Past  tell me all that was 
somehow  true.
Passage B by Ray Bradbury

The facts about John  Huff, aged twelve,  are simple and  soon  stated.  He  could  pathfind  more  
trails  than anyone  since time  began,  could  leap from the sky like a chimpanzee  from  a  vine, 
 could  live  underwater  two minutes  and  slide  iifty  yards  downstream  from  where you  last  
saw  him. The  baseballs  you  pitched  him  he hit in  the  apple  trees,  knocking  down  
harvests.  He  ran laughing.  He sat easy.  He  was  not a bully.  He was kind.
He  knew  the  names  of  all  the  wild  flowers  and  when the  moon  would  rise  and  set.  
He  was,  in  fact,  the  only god  living  in  the  whole  of  Green  Town,  Illinois,  during the 
twentieth  century  that  Douglas  Spaulding  knew of.
And  right  now  he  and  Douglas  were  hiking  out
beyond  town  on  another  warm  and  marble-round  day, the  sky  blue  blown-glass   reaching 
 high,  the  creeks bright  with  mirror  waters  fanning  over  white  stones.  It was a day as 
perfect  as the flame of a candle.
Douglas  walked  through  it thinking  it would  go on
this  way  forever.  The  sound  of  a  good  friend  whistling like  an  oriole,   pegging   
the  softball,   as  you  horse- danced,  key-jingled  the  dusty  paths;  things  were  at hand 
and  would  remain.
It  was  such  a  fine  day  and  then  suddenly  a  cloud
crossed  the  sky,  covered  the  sun,  and  did  not  move again.

John  Huff  had  been  speaking  quietly  for  several minutes.  Now  Douglas  stopped  on  the  
path  and  looked over at him.


I had to send  myself  back,  with  words  as catalysts, to  open  the  memories  out  and  see  
what  they  had  to offer.

         So from the age of  twenty-four  to thirty-six  hardly a day  passed  when  I didn’t  
stroll  myself  across  a recollection  of  my  grandparents'   northern  Illinois  grass, hoping 
 to come  across  some  old  half-burnt  firecracker, a rusted  toy, or a fragment  of  letter  
written  to  myself  in
some  young  year  hoping  to  contact  the  older  person  I became  to  remind  him  of  his  
past,  his  life,  his  people, his joys, and his drenching sorrows.

Along  the  way  I came  upon  and  collided,  through word-association,  with  old  and  true  
friendships.  I  bor-
rowed  my  friend  John  Huff  from  my  childhood  in  Ari- zona  and  shipped  him  East  to  
Green  Town  so  that  I could  say good-bye to him properly.

Along   the   way,   I   sat   me   down   to  breakfasts, lunches,  and  dinners  with  the  long  
dead  and  much
loved.

Thus I fell into surprise. I came on the old and best ways  o1 writing  through  ignorance  and  
experiment  and

         “John, say that again.”
“You heard  me the first  time, Doug.” “Did you say you  were—going  away?”
John  took  a yellow and green  train  ticket  solemnly from his pocket and they  both looked  at 
it.

         “Tonight!”  said  Douglas.  “My  gosh!  Tonight  we were going  to play  Red Light,  
Green  Light and Statues! How  come,  all  of  a  sudden?  You  been  here  in  Green Town  all my 
life.  You just don't pick  up and leave!”
“It's  my  father,”  said John.  “He's  got  a job in  Mil-
waukee.  We weren't  sure until today  ...    ”

They  sat  under  an  old  oak  tree  on  the  side  of  the hill  looking  back  at  town.  Out  
beyond,  in  sunlight,  the town  was  painted  with  heat,  the  windows  all  gaping. Douglas  
wanted  to run  back in  there where the town, by
its  very  weight,  its  houses,  their  bulk,  might  enclose and prevent John's ever getting 
up and running off.
