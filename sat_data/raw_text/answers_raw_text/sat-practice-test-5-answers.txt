the history book Lymie is reading.
 
Choice A is incorrect because rather than establishing what Lymie does every night, the first paragraph 
describes what Lymie is doing on
 
one
 
night. Choice B is inco
rrect because nothing in the first paragraph 
indicates when the passage takes place, as the details provided (such as the restaurant and the book) 
are not specific to one era. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the first paragraph clearly 
foreshadows
 
a later event.
 
QUESTION

-
38). It is
 
reasonable to assume that Irma thinks Lymie is finished eating because he is no longer 
holding his fork.

e 
table.
 
QUESTION
 
4
 
Choice A is the best answer

restaurant to be loud and bothersome, as their entrance means he is no longer able to concentrate on 

 
than there seemed any occasion for . . . and their laughter was too loud. 


-
59).
 
Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because lines 
55

when his father joins him in the 
restaurant (choice D). 
 
QUESTION
 
6
 
Choice A is the best answer

loud (choice 
B), because he has finished reading a section of the book (choice C), or because he is getting ready to 
leave (choice D).
 
QUESTION

person who is wan and l
osing vitality, not someone who is healthy and in good shape (choice A), angry 
and intimidating (choice B), or emotionally anxious (choice C).
 
QUESTION
 
8
 
Choice B is the best answer
. In the last paragraph of the passage, Mr. Peters is described as being 

-
81). Later 


-
91). The main idea of the l
ast paragraph is that Mr. Peters still thinks of 
himself as young, or at least acts as if he is a younger version of himself.
 
Choice A is incorrect because Mr. Peters is spending time with Lymie, his son, and there is no indication 
that he generally does n
ot spend time with his family. Choice C is incorrect because although there are

Choice B is the best answer



 

means appropriate or fitting, not becoming known (choice A), becoming more advance
d (choice C), or 
simply occurring (choice D).
 
QUESTION
 
11
 
Choice B is the best answer
. In Passage 1, Beecher makes the point that even if women in her society 
are perceived as being inferior to men, they are still able to effect considerable influence on
 
that society: 

designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or all
-

-
10).
 
Choice A is incorrect because Bee
cher describes the dynamic between men and women in terms of the 
way they can change society, not in terms of security and physical safety. Choice C is incorrect because 
even though Beecher implies that women have fewer rights in society than men do, she d

women have fewer responsibilities. Choice D is incorrect because Beecher does not assert that women 
are superior to men.
 
QUESTION
 
12
 
Choice A is the best answer
. The previous question asks what point Beecher makes regarding the 
relationsh
ip between men and women in her society, with the answer being that women are considered 
inferior but can still have influence. This is supported in lines 6
-

subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it
 
was designed that her duties or her 
influence should be any the less important, or all
-

 
Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous 
question about the point Beecher makes regarding the rel
ationship between men and women in her 
society. Instead, they describe ways men can affect society (choices B and C) and explain how certain 
actions undertaken by a woman can be viewed negatively (choice D). 
 
QUESTION
 
13
 
Choice B is the best answer
. In t
he third paragraph (lines 22
-
37), Beecher suggests that women can be 


m, to which they 

influence society by influencing the men around them; in other words, women have an indirect 
influence on public life.
 

Choices A, C, and D 
are incorrect because lines 34
-
37 make it clear that Beecher believes women do 

on public life is ignored because most men are not interested (choice 
A), unnecessary because men do 
not need help governing society (choice C), or merely symbolic because women tend to be idealistic 
(choice D).
 
QUESTION

. When describing how men and
 
women can influence society, Beecher says 

-
12). In the context of the 

unique 
or distinctive.
 


something unusual and odd (choice A), unexpec
ted (choice B), or rare (choice D).
 
QUESTION
 
16
 
Choice A is the best answer
. In Passage 2, Grimk
é
 
makes the main point that people have rights because 
they are human, not because of their gender or race. This is clear in lines 58
-
60, when Grimk
é
 
states t
hat 

rights
, because they are 
moral
 
beings: the rights of 
all
 
men grow out of their moral

68, when Grimk

being, then the
 
mere circumstance of sex
 
does not
 
give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to 

 
Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because Grimk
é
 
primarily emphasizes that all men and women 

-
6
6). Her 
central claim is not that men and women need to work together to change society (choice B), that moral 
rights are the distinguishing characteristic separating humans from animals (choice C), or that there 
should be equal opportunities for men and w
omen to advance and succeed.
 
QUESTION
 
17
 

Choice B is the best answer
. In Passage 2, Grimk
é
 
makes the point that human rights are not fleeting or 

moral na
ture. She emphasizes that human rights exist even if societal laws attempt to contradict or 

cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as i
s that of Lyman Beecher: it is stamped on 

-
65).
 
Choices A and D are incorrect because in Passage 2, Grimk
é
 
makes the point that human rights are 
inherent and unchanging, not that they are viewed diff
erently in different societies (choice A) or that 
they have changed and developed over time (choice D). Choice C is incorrect because Grimk
é
 

describe a clash between human rights and moral responsibilities; instead, she says that humans have 
rights
 

moral
 

-
59).
 
QUESTION
 
18
 
Choice B is the best answer
. The previous question asks what point Grimk
é
 
makes about human rights 
in Passage 2, with the answer being that they exist and have moral authority whether or not the
y are 
established by societal law. This is supported in lines 61
-

slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: it 
is stamped on his moral being, and is, l

 
Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous 
question about the point Grimk
é
 
makes about human rights in Passage 2. Instead, they explain the 

(choice A), indicate what would happen if rights were determined by 
gender (choice C), and discuss why gender is irrelevant to rights (choice D). 
 
QUESTION
 
19
 
Choice B is the best answer
. In Passage 1, Beecher asserts that men and women naturally have di
fferent 


-
2). She goes on to argue that a woman should act within her subordinate role to 



-
46). In Passage 2, Grimk
é
 
takes issue with the idea that men and women have different 
rights and roles. She asserts that as moral beings all people have the same inherent rights and stat
es 

mere circumstance of sex
 
does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to 

-
68).
 
Choice A is incorrect because Passage 2 does not discuss the practical difficulties of something that is 
proposed in Passage 1 but 
rather argues against the main point of Passage 1. Choice C is incorrect 
because Passage 2 does not provide historical context for the view expressed in Passage 1; the passages 
were published at around the same time and both discuss contemporary society. C
hoice D is incorrect 
because Passage 2 does not elaborate on implications found in Passage 1 as much as it disputes the 
ideas explicitly expressed in Passage 1.
 

QUESTION
 
20
 
Choice A is the best answer
. While Beecher and Grimk
é
 
clearly disagree regarding 

society, the passages suggest that both authors share the belief that women do have moral duties and 

in society to the other sex, it 
is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be 
any the less important, or all
-

-
10). She suggests that women do have an obligation to 
use their influence to bring about beneficial changes in society. In Passage 
2, Grimk
é
 
asserts that all 

moral
 

-



-
83).
 
Choice B is incorrect because neither author suggests that when men work to bring about political 
changes, they often do so out of consideration for others rather than considerations for themselves. 
Choice C is incorrect because neither passage discusses 

although both authors suggest that women do have ethical and moral obligations. Choice D is incorrect 
because in Passage 1 Beecher argues that women should avoid direct political activism, cautioning 
against 

 
QUESTION
 
21
 
Choice D is the best answer
. In lines 65
-
68 of Passage 2, Grimk
é
 

the nature of our moral being, then the 
mere circumstance of sex
 
does not give to man higher rights and 


appointed to one sex the sup

women have fundamentally different natures. Therefore, Beecher most likely would have disagreed 
with Grimk
é

 
Choices A and B are incorrect because Beecher fundamentally d
isagrees with Grimk
é
 
regarding the basic 
nature and societal roles of men and women, making it very unlikely that she would have viewed 
Grimk
é

-
68 with either sympathy or agreement. Choice C is incorrect because 

ssarily have been dismayed by Grimk
é

disagreed with it, and she does not indicate that the role of women in society is more difficult to play 
than is that of men.
 
QUESTION
 
22
 
Choice A is the best answer
. In line 
14, the passage states that industrial agriculture has become 

or straightforward.

something that requires little effort (choice D).
 
QUESTION
 
23
 
Choice B is th
e best answer
. The passage clearly states that conventional agriculture is very efficient, 


-

farming delivered a lower yield for every 

-
52). It can therefore be understood from the passage that conventional agriculture 
does a good job maximizing the output of the land that is farmed.
 
Choice A is incorrect because the passage st
ates how efficient conventional agriculture is in regard to 
the amount of food it can produce but does not indicate that it produces a significantly wide variety of 
fruits and vegetables. Choice C is incorrect because even if the passage does say that each
 
American 

-
17), it never claims that 
conventional agriculture can satisfactorily feed everyone in the world. Choice D is incorrect because the 
passage states that conventional agricultur
e uses a great deal of nitrogen, not that it changes the need 
for nitrogen in plant growth one way or the other.
 
QUESTION
 
24
 
Choice A is the best answer

31).
 
Choices B, C, and D are incorrect because they are not supported by the passage. The passage never 
states that many environmentalists believe that conventional farming reduces the need t
o convert 
wilderness to farmland (choice B), is in any way good for the environment (choice C), 
or
 
protects wildlife 
habitats (choice D).
 
QUESTION
 
25
 
Choice B is the best answer
. The previous question asks how environmentalists perceive conventional 
agri
culture, with the answer being that they believe it produces a product that is less healthy and more 
environmentally destructive than that produced by organic farming. This is supported in lines 28

question about how environmentalists perceive the efforts of conve

food produced. Choice D is incorrect because these lines focus 
on a drawback to organic farming.
 
QUESTION
 
26
 
Choice C is the best answer
. The passage makes it clear that while both conventional and organic 
farming need nitrogen for plant growth, conventional farming uses synthetic fertilizers and organic does 

Conventional agriculture makes use of 171 million metric tons of synthetic fertilizer each year, and 
all that nitrogen enables much faster plant growth than the slower release of nitrogen from the compost

5).
 
Choice A is incorrect because the passage does not state that conventional and organic farming are 

(lines 42
-
43) but does not indicate that it always req
uires dramatically more land. Choice B is incorrect 
because the passage does not state that organic farming uses artificial chemicals. Choice D is incorrect 
because the passage mentions nitrogen runoff only as a product of conventional farming, not organic
 
farming, and does not indicate that only the nitrogen in conventional fertilizers is dangerous.
 
QU
ESTION
 
27
 
Choice D is the best answer
. The previous question asks about the relationship between conventional 
agriculture and organic farming, with the ans
wer being that unlike organic farms, conventional farms 
use synthetic fertilizers. This is supported in lines 61
-

million metric tons of synthetic fertilizer each year, and all that nitrogen enables much faster
 
plant 

 
Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because the lines cited do not support the answer to the previous 
question about the relationship between convent
ional and organic farming, instead describing the 
efficiency only of conventional agriculture (choice A), discussing one perceived positive aspect of 
conventional agriculture (choice B), and highlighting a drawback of organic farming (choice C).

29
 
Choice D is the best answer
. The passage sta
tes that conventional agriculture can be superior to organic 

the passage is referring to the pure number of calories delivered by foods.
 
Choices A, B
, and C are incorrect because in the context of discussing the calories foods can provide, 

seen through (choice A), are somehow sudden or happen unexpect
edly (choice B), or are at a very sharp 
angle (choice C).
 
QUESTION
 
30
 
Choice B is the best answer
. Figure 1 shows that the organic yield as a percentage of conventional yield 
is similar for cereals and all crops, with both yielding roughly 75%.
 
Choice A 
is incorrect because figure 1 shows that the organic yield as a percentage of conventional yield 
is higher for fruits (just under 100%) than for vegetables (just under 70%). Choice C is incorrect because 
figure 1 shows there were only 28 observations for o
ilseed crops. Choice D is incorrect because figure 1 
shows that the organic yield as a percentage of conventional yield is higher for oilseed crops 
(approximately 90%) than for vegetables (just under 70%).
 
QUESTION
 
31
 
Choice D is the best answer
. Every o
rganically grown species represented in figure 2 produces a smaller 
yield than do their conventional counterparts. All of the organically grown species are within a range of 
approximately 60

90% of the conventional yield. 
 
Choice A is incorrect because fig
ure 2 shows that soybeans have the highest yield (approximately 90%), 
not the lowest. Choice B is incorrect because figure 2 shows that organically grown barley and maize are 
produced at a lower yield than the conventionally grown species (just below 70% a
nd just below 90%, 
respectively), not a comparable one. Choice C is incorrect because figure 2 shows that soybeans, not 
tomatoes, have the highest yield of the organically grown species.

believes that crowds may 
be more effective than individuals when arriving at quantitative answers rather than qualitative results. 
Nothing in the passage suggests that the author believes that crowds are better at starting 
disagreements than studying an is

ry 
there is virtually no difference between the mean scores of the two types of comments, while for the 
business category there is almost a 1.0

point difference between the mean scores).
 
Choices A and B are incorrect because the passage provides no data f
or artificially down

comments or negative social influence. Choice C is incorrect because the figure applies only to one 
context (mean score of control comments versus mean score of artificially up

Choice D is correct
. From the graph, the 
y

form, the equation for line 
 
is 
y

Choice A is incorrect. It is the equation of the vertical line that passes through the point (1, 0). 
Choice B is incorrect. It is the equation of the horizontal line that passes through 
the point (0, 
1). Choice C is incorrect. The line defined by this equation has

QUESTION

Choice A is correct
. A circle has 360 degrees of arc. In the circle shown, 
O
 
is t
he center of the 
circle and angle 
AOC
 
is a central angle of the circle. From the figure, the two diameters that 
meet to form angle 
AOC
 
are perpendicular, so the measure of angle 
AOC
 
is 90

. This central 
angle intercepts minor arc 
AC
, meaning minor arc 
AC
 
has 90

 
of arc. Since the circumference 
(length) of the entire circle is 36, the length of minor arc 
AC
 
is 
.
 
Choices B, C, and D are incorrect. The perpendicular diameters divide the circumference of the 
circle into four equal
 
arcs; therefore, minor arc 
AC
 
is 
 
of the circumference. However, the 
lengths in choices B and C are, respectively, 
 
and 
 
the circumference of the circle, and the 
length in cho
ice D is the length of the entire circumference. None of these lengths is 
 
the 
circumference.

QUESTION

Choice C is correct
. If 
f
 
is a function of 
x
, then the graph of 
f
 
in th
e 
xy
-
plane consists of all points 
(
x
, 
f
(
x
)). An 
x
-
intercept is where the graph intersects the 
x
-
axis; since all points on the 
x
-
axis 
have 
y
-
coordinate 0, the graph of 
f
 
will cross the 
x
-
axis at values of 
x
 
such that 
f
(
x
) = 0. 
Therefore, the graph of a func
tion 
f
 
will have no 
x
-
intercepts if and only if 
f
 
has no real zeros. 
Likewise, the graph of a quadratic function with no real zeros will have no 
x
-
intercepts.
 
Choice A is incorrect. The graph of a linear function in the 
xy
-
plane whose rate of change is no
t 
zero is a line with a nonzero slope. The 
x
-
axis is a horizontal line and thus has slope 0, so the 
graph of the linear function whose rate of change is not zero is a line that is not parallel to the 
x
-
axis. Thus, the graph must intersect the 
x
-
axis at som
e point, and this point is an 
x
-
intercept 

of the graph. Choices B and D are incorrect because the graph of any function with a real zero 
must have an 
x
-
intercept.

Choices A, B, and C are incorrect because substituting any of these values for

Thus the total, in dollars, Jackie earns in a week that she works 
x

a tutor and 
y

220. The condition that Jackie can work no more 
than 20 hours per week is represented by the i

20. These two inequalities form 
the system shown in choice C.
 
Choice A is incorrect. This system represents the conditions that Jackie earns no more than 
$220 and works at least 20 hours. Choice B is incorrect. The first inequality in th

T
 
+ 331.4 is the value of 
S
 
when 
T

The value 
T

C. Since 
S
(
T

331.4 is the speed of sound, in meters per second, when the temperature is 0°C. 
 
Choice B is incorrect. When 
T

0.6
°
C, 
S
(
T
) = 0.6(0.6) + 331.4 = 331.76, not 331.4, meters per

meters per second for every increase of temperature by 1
°
C, as shown by the equation 0.6(
T
 
+ 
1) +
 
331.4 = (0.6
T

Multiplying

QUESTION

Choice C is correct
. Because 
f
 
is a linear function of 
x
, the equation 
f
(
x
) = 
mx
 
+ 
b
, where 
m
 
and 
b
 
ar
e constants, can be used to define the relationship between 
x
 
and
 
f
(
x
). In this equation, 
m
 
represents the increase in the value of 
f
(
x
) for every increase in the value of 
x
 
by 1. From the 
table, it can be determined that the value of 
f
(
x
) increases by 8 f
or every increase in the value 
of 
x
 
by 2. In other words, for the function 
f
 
the value of 
m
 
is
, or 4. The value of 
b 
can be found 
by substituting the values of 
x
 
and 
f
(
x
) from any row of the table and the value of 
m 
into the 
equat
ion 
f
(
x
) = 
mx
 
+ 
b
 
and solving for 
b
. For example, using 
x
 
= 1, 
f
(
x
) = 5, and 
m
 
= 4 yields 5 = 
4(1) + 
b
. Solving for 
b
 
yields 
b
 
= 1. Therefore, the equation defining the function 
f
 
can be written 
in the form 
f
(
x
) = 4
x
 
+ 1. 
 
Choices A, B, and D are incorrec
t. Any equation defining the linear function 
f
 
must give values of 
f
(
x
) for corresponding values of 
x
, as shown in each row of the table. According to the table, if 
x
 
= 3, 
f
(
x
) = 13. However, substituting 
x
 
= 3 into the equation given in choice A gives 
f
(3
) = 2(3) + 
3, or 
f
(3) = 9, not 13. Similarly, substituting 
x
 
= 3 into the equation given in choice B gives 
f
(3) =

Choice A is correct
. If 2.5 ounces of chocolate are needed for each muffin, then the number of 
ounces of chocolate needed to make 48 muffins is 48 × 2.5 = 120 ounces. Since 1 pound = 16
 
ounces, the number of pounds that is equivalent to 120 ounces is 
 
= 7.5 pounds. Therefore, 
7.5 pounds of chocolate are needed to make the 48 muffins.
 
Choice B is incorrect. If 10 pounds of chocolate were needed to make 48 muffin
s, then the total 
number of ounces of chocolate needed would be 10 × 16 = 160 ounces. The number of ounces 
of chocolate per muffin would then be 
 
= 3.33 ounces per muffin, not 2.5 ounces per 
muffin. Choices C and D a
re also 
incorr
ect. Following the same procedures as used to test choice 
B gives 16.8 ounces per muffin for choice C and 40 ounces per muffin for choice D, not 2.5 
ounces per muffin. Therefore, 50.5 and 120 pounds cannot be the number of pounds needed to 
make 48 signatur

t


 
90 = 140 pounds. 
Therefore, an object that weighs 100 pounds on Earth weighs 140 more pounds on Jupiter than 
it weighs on Venus.
 
Choice A is incorrect because it is the weight, in pounds, of the object on Venus. Choice B is 
incorrect because it is the w

Choice B is correct
. Let 
n
 
be the number of novels and 
m
 
be the number of magazines t
hat 
Sadie purchased. If Sadie purchased a total of 11 novels and magazines, then 
n
 
+ 
m
 
= 11. It is 
given that the combined price of 11 novels and magazines is $20. Since each novel sells for $4 
and each magazine sells for $1, it follows that 4
n
 
+ 
m
 
= 20. S
o the system of equations below 
must hold.
 
4
n
 
+ 
m
 
= 20
 
 
n
 
+ 
m
 
= 11
 
Subtracting side by side the second equation from the first equation yields 3
n
 
= 9, so 
n
 
= 3. 
Therefore, Sadie purchased 3 novels.
 
Choice A is incorrect. If 2 novels were purchased, then a
 
total of $8 was spent on novels. That 
leaves $12 to be spent on magazines, which means that 12 magazines would have been 
purchased. However, Sadie purchased a total of 11 novels and magazines. Choices C and D are 
incorrect. If 4 novels were purchased, the
n a total of $16 was spent on novels. That leaves $4 to 
be spent on magazines, which means that 4 magazines would have been purchased. By the 

same logic, if Sadie purchased 5 novels, she would have no money at all ($0) to buy magazines. 
However, Sadie purc
hased a total of 11 novels and magazines.

the start of the motion (
t
 
= 0); at this moment, the mark is at its highest point from the ground. 
As the wheel rolls, the mark approaches the ground, its dist
ance from the ground decreasing 
until it reaches 0

the point where it touches the ground. After that, the mark moves up and 
away from the ground, its distance from the ground increasing until it reaches its maximum 
height from the ground. This is the momen
t when the wheel has completed a full rotation. The 
remaining part of the graph shows the distance of the mark from the ground during the second 
rotation of the wheel. Therefore, of the given choices, only choice D is in agreement with the 
given informatio
n. 
 

Choice A is incorrect because the speed at which the wheel is rolling does not change over time, 
meaning the graph representing the speed would be a horizontal line. Choice B is incorrect 
because the distance of the wheel from its starting point to it
s ending point increases 
continuously; the graph shows a quantity that changes periodically over time, alternately 
decreasing and increasing. Choice C is incorrect because the distance of the mark from the 
center of the wheel is constant and equals the rad

dollar increase of t
he purchase price is different 
from what is suggested by these choices. For example, the Glenview Street property was

Choice B is correct
. Let 
x
 
be the original price, in dollars, of the Glenview Street property. After 
the 40% discount, the price of the property became 0.6
x
 
dollars, and after the additional 20% 
off the discount
ed price, the price of the property became 0.8(0.6
x
). Thus, in terms of the 
original price of the property, 
x
, the purchase price of the property is 0.48
x
. It follows that 0.48
x
 
= 140,000. Solving this equation for 
x
 
gives 
. There
fore, of the given choices, 
$291,700 best approximates the original price of the Glenview Street property. 
 
Choice A is incorrect because it is the result of dividing the purchase price of the property by 
0.4, as though the purchase price were 40% of the 
original price. Choice C is incorrect because it 
is the closest to dividing the purchase price of the property by 0.6, as though the purchase price 
were 60% of the original price. Choice D is incorrect because it is the result of dividing the 
purchase pric
e of the property by 0.8, as though the purchase price were 80% of the original

The correct answer is 9.
 
Since the poin
t (2, 5) lies on the graph of 
y
 
= 
f
(
x
) in the 
xy
-
plane, the 
ordered pair (2, 5) must satisfy the equation 
y
 
= 
f
(
x
). That is, 5 = 
f
(2), or 5 = 
k

. This equation 
simplifies to 5 =

k
 
is 9. 
 
QUESTION

The corr
ect answer is 13.
 
Let 
w
 
represent the width of the rectangular garden, in feet. Since the 
length of the garden will be 5 feet longer than the width of the garden, the length of the garden 
will be 
w
 
+ 5 feet. Thus the area of the garden will be 
w
(
w
 
+ 5). It
 
is also given that the area of 
the garden will be 104 square feet. Therefore, 
w
(
w
 
+ 5) = 104, which is equivalent to 
w
2
 
+ 5
w
 

 
104 = 0. The quadratic formula can be used or the equation above can be factored to result in 
(
w
 
+ 13)(
w
 

w
 
= 8 and 
w
 

of the garden must be 8 feet. This means the length of the garden
 
must be 8 + 5 = 13 feet.
 
QUESTION

The correct answer is 80.
 
The measure of an angle inscribed in a circle is half the measure of 
the central angle that intercepts the same arc. That is, 
. Also, the sum of the interior 
angles 
of quadrilateral 
ABCP
 
is 360°, and the measure of the obtuse angle 
P
 
is 360°
 

x
°. Hence, 
. Simplifying this equation gives 
, and so 
x
 
= 80. 
 
Alternate approach: If points 
A
 
and 
P
 
are joined, then the triangles that will be formed, 
APB
 
and 
APC
, are isosceles because 
PA
 
= 
PB
 
= 
PC
.
 
It follows that the base angles on both triangles each 
have measure of 20°. Angle 
A
 
consists of two base angles, and therefore, 
. Since the 
measure of an angle inscribed in a circle is half the measure of the central angle that i
ntercepts 
the same arc, it follows that the value of 
x 
is 80°. 
 
QUESTION
 
37
 
The correct answer is 43.5, 43, or 44.
 

0.6 + 15.4 + 1.4 = 17.4 miles. Ms. Simon took 24 minutes to drive this distance. Sinc
e there are 
60 minutes in one hour, her average speed, in miles per hour, for this trip is 
 
= 43.5 
miles per hour. Based on the directions, 87/2 or 43.5 can be gridded as the correct answer. We 

are accepting 43 and 44 as additional correct answers because
 
the precision of the 
measurements provided does not support an answer
 
with three significant digits.
 
QUESTION
 
38
 
The correct answer is 6.
 
Ms. Simon travels 15.4 miles on the freeway, and her average speed 
for this portion of the trip is 50 miles per hour when there is no traffic delay. Therefore, when 
there is no traffic delay, Ms. Simon spends 
on the freeway. Since there 
are 60 minutes in one hour, she spends (0.308)(60) = 18.48 minutes on the freeway when there 
is no delay. Leaving at 7:00 a.m. results in a trip that is 33% longer, and 33% of 18.48 minutes is 
6.16; the travel time for each 
of the other two segments does not change. Therefore, rounded 
to the nearest minute, it takes Ms. Simon 6 more minutes to drive to her workplace when she 
leaves at 7:00 a.m.
