The  passage  begins  with  a  female  narrator  traveling  to  her hometown.

The moon gives some light and I can make out the contours of the land, see the faint reflection in 
the lakes and ponds we pass. Several times I see or imagine I see glowing eyes staring  back at me 
from a patch of  woods
beside the track. When  we pass through the tiny towns, I  try  to  read  their  signs,  catch  
their  names  from  their water  towers  or  grain  elevators.  Occasionally  the  train stops at 
...   Portage ...   Winona  ...   Red Wing.
In  my  sleeping  compartment,  watching  the  night
countryside, so much world rolls by my window. Like a voyeur  I  watch  the  various  reunion  
scenes. I feel  these scenes  add  up  to  something,  some  meaning  or  lesson about  all  life, 
and  I  try  to  put  it into  words  for  myself but find I can't. I finally  give up, roll over, 
go to sleep,
and dream.
But  now  I  am  awake,  keeping  my  vigil  over  the Midwest's  pastoral  kingdom. Chicago, even 
Minneapo- lis  seems  a  long  way  away.  A  few  hours  later,  still  in
Meat Market and the old Pioneer office. We rebuild  the Landmark  Hotel,  take  down  the  vinyl  
fronts  from  the grocery  store,  change  the  light  posts,  the  awnings,  the names  of  the  
current  businesses.  I  put  back  the  old
depot,  you  the  corner  funeral  home.  But  soon  we  are distracted  and  leave  things  
half  constructed  when  we begin  to  add  the  people,  what’s-his-name, the  square dance  
caller;  Ed,  the  fire  chief;  and  Lydia,  the  town's best gossip. On  the walk  back home, we 
have  begun  to
list  very  specific  things,  which  is  the closest  we get  to the  intangibles:  the  
rental  meat  lockers,  the  four-digit telephone  numbers,  the  free  ice  cream  during  dairy 
month.
Late  at  night  in  my  old  bed,  I  listen  to  the  night
sounds   of   the   house  and  fall  asleep  counting   the changes  that  have  come  to  my  
little  hometown:  The park  is  off  limits  after  dark  now,  the  football  field  is fenced 
in, one-hour  photo has come to town along  with a  tanning  salon  and  a pizza  parlor. The dry  
goods  store
is  gone, the  dairy, long  gone.  People  lock  their  houses now  more  than once a year  
when  the carnival  comes  to town.  But  all  of  these  changes  pale  in  comparison  to what  
has  replaced  the  bait  shop,  the  used  car  lot,  and Mr. Morton's  small farm, what has  
sprung  up on High-
way 59 at the edge of town: Las Vegas—style gambling.


Taking  the  train  back,  I  decide  to  put  on  pajamas and  crawl  under  the sheets, hoping  
to  trick  myself  into

the  deep  night  hours,  the  train  arrives  at  my  stop,
Detroit  Lakes,  Minnesota,  the  closest  I  can  get  to  my destination.
Suddenly,  as  I  descend  the  two  steps  from  the
train,  the  porter  hands  me  into  one  of  the  reunion scenes. “Hi, honey,  how  was  the 
trip? Did  you  get  any
a  good  night's  sleep.  It  seems  to  work.  I  have  slept soundly  for  several  hours,  
but  then  the  dreams  start.  I fall in and out of them. But they are not the usual night- mares. 
 I  am  in  a  place  where  folks  know  you  ten, fif- teen, twenty  years after  you've left and 
still see in your face that of  your grandfather or aunt or cousin. I know I

sleep?” “A little. Been  waiting long?” “Long enough  to beat  your  dad in two games of 
cribbage    . . ” Glancing back  at  the train  windows, I imagine  I am looking  into eyes hidden 
behind mirrored sunglasses.


        I  think  about  progress  a  lot  in  the  next  few  days and  about  what  passes  
for  progress.  Nightly  we  walk about town, talk  marriages  and funerals,  then sit on the newly 
 installed  benches  on  Main  Street.  Together  we assemble from our  memories  the town  as it 
was  twenty or twenty-five  years ago. We remember  the little Model
am home and I feel safe.
I have  an early  breakfast  with  a would-be  journal- ist  and  some  ski  vacationers  who  want 
 to  talk  about election  prospects.  I  merely  feign  attention.  I  nod  or laugh on cue, while 
I try to read upside-down  a story in
the would-be  journalist's  newspaper  that has caught my eye. It  is  about  the  Russian  
space  station  and  the  cos- monaut  who  had  been  up  in  orbit  during  the  takeover attempt 
 and  ultimate  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union. After  sixteen  long  months,  they  are  
bringing  the  cap-
sule back. While the train carries me back to my current home  and  away  from  my former, I 
keep thinking  about



that  poor  cosmonaut  coming  back  to  find  his  whole world   changed,   to   find   himself   
a   man   without   a country—at least without  the country  he left behind.

         I  watch  the  ten  o'clock  national  news  broadcast.  I see him emerge from the 
capsule.  I see him try  to stand and  have  his  knees  buckle.  I  know  they  said  it  was 
because  he hadn't  been  able  to exercise for such  a long time,  but  I  wonder  if  his  
weak-kneed  feeling  might  not
have  more  to  do  with  what  he  saw  out  the  window  of the  space  station  and  with  
how  the  world  was  happen- ing around  without  him.
