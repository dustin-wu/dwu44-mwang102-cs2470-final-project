Recently  I was reminded  of  just how  powerful  ants can  be  when  inflicting  damage  on  
intruders.  A  team  of biomechanists  has  studied  the incredibly  speedy  bite of a  group  of  
Central  and  South  American  ants.  The  team
clocked  the  bite  as  the  fastest  on  the  planet—and  dis- covered  that  it  also  gives  
the  ants  the  unique  ability  to jump  with  their  jaws,  adding  to  an  impressive  array  of 
already  known  defenses.
Trap-jaw  ants  nest  in  leaf  litter,  rather  than  under-
 ground  or  in  mounds.  There  they  often  leed  on  well- armored  and  elusive  prey,  
including  other  species  of ants.  As  they  stalk  their dinner,  the trap-jaws  hold  their 
mandibles  wide apart, often cocked open at 180 degrees or  more  by  a  latch  mechanism.  When  
minute  trigger
hairs on the inner edge of  the mandible  come in contact with  something,   the  jaws  snap  
shut  at  speeds  now known  to reach  1miles  per  hour.  No  passerby  could outrace  that.  
The  astounding ly  high  speed  gives  the jaws,  despite  their  light  weight,  enough  force  
to  crack
open  the  armor  of  most  prey  and  get  at  the  tasty  meat inside.

The  key  to  the  jaws'  speed  (and  their  even  more amazing  acceleration)  is  that  the  
release  comes  from stored  energy  produced  by  the strong  but  slow  muscles
of  the jaw.  Think  how  an  archer  slowly  draws  an  arrow in  a  bowstring  against  the  
flex  of  a  bow:  nearly  all  the energy  from  the archer's  muscles  pours  into  the flexing 
of  the bow. When  released,  the energy stored  in the bow wings  the  arrow  toward  its  target  
much  faster  than  the
archer  could  by  throwing  the  arrow  like  a  javelin.  The biomechanics  of  energy  
storage is the domain  of  Sheila

N.  Patek  and  Joseph  E.  Baio,  both  biomechanists  at the University  of  California,  
Berkeley.  They  teamed  up with  two  ant  experts,  Brian  L.  Fisher  of  the  California
Academy  of  Sciences  in  San  Francisco  and  Andrew  V. Suarez   of   the   University    of 
  Illinoi s   at   Urbana- Champaign,  to  look  at  the  trap-jaw  ant  Odontomachus bauri.
Fisher,   Suarez,   and   other   field   biologists   had
already  noted  that  catching  0.  bauri  was  like  grabbing for  popping  popcorn—and   very 
 hot  popcorn  at  that, because  a painful  sting goes  with an ant’s  trap-jaw  bite. The  
insects  bounced  around  in  a  dizzying  frenzy  and propelled  themselves   many  times  their  
body  length
when  biologists  or  smaller  intruders  approached  them. Patek  and  Baio  made  high-speed  
video  images  of  their movements,  and  discovered  that the secret of  their self- propulsion   
was   the  well-executed   “firing”   of   their mandibles. They  also observed  that mandibles  
started to
decelerate  before  they  meet—possibly  to  avoid  self- inflicted  damage.  Most important,  
the ants  had  two dis- tinct modes  of  aerial locomotion.

In  the  so-called  escape  jump,  an  ant  orients  its head  and  jaws  perpendicular  to  the  
ground,  then  slams its   face   straight   down.   That   triggers   the   cocked mandibles  to  
release  with  a  force  4times  the  ant’s body  weight,  launching  the  insect  ten  or  
more  body lengths  nearly  straight  into  the  air.  The  ant  doesn't seem  to  go  in  any  
particular  direction,  but  the  jump  is
presumably  fast  and  unpredictable  enough  to  help  the insect  evade,  say,  the  probing  
tongue  of  a  lizard.  Not only  can  the  jumping  ant  gain  height  and  sow  confu- sion,  but 
 it  may  also  get  to  a  new  vantage  point  from which  to relaunch  an attack.

         The  second  kind  of  jaw-propelled  locomotion  is even  more common  than escape  
jumping.  If  an  intruder enters  the  ants'  nest,  one  of  the  ants  bangs  its  jaws against  
the  intruder,  which  triggers  the  trap-jaw  and propels  the  interloper  (if  small  enough)  
in  one  direc-
tion,  out  of  the  nest,  and  the ant  in the  other.  Often  the force sends  the ant 
skimming  an  inch off  the ground  for nearly  a foot. The  attack, for obvious  reasons, is known 
as  the “bouncer  defense.”  In  the  wild,  gangs  of  defend- ing  ants  team  up  to  attack  
hostile  strangers,  sending
them  head over heels out of  the nest.
From  an  evolutionary  point  of  view,  the  trap-jaws are  an  intriguing  story.  The  ants  
clearly  evolved  an entirely  new function,  propulsion,  for a system  that  was already  
useful—chewing  up  prey.  Several  lineages  of
trap-jaw  ants  have  independently  hit  on  the  tactic  of storing  energy  in  their  jaws  
to  penetrate  well-defended prey.   In   Odontomachus,   the   horizontal,   bouncer- defense  
jump  could  have  arisen  out  of  attempts  to  bite intruders,  but  the  high,  escape  
jump—with  jaws  aimed
directly  at  the  ground—must  have  arisen  from  a differ- ent,   perhaps   accidental   
kind   of   behavior.   Such   a serendipitous  event  would  have  been  a  rare  instance  in 
which  banging  one's  head  against  the  ground  got  good results.
