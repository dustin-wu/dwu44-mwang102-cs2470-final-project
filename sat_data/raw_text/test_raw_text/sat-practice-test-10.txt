Miss Grace Spivey arrived in Threestep, Georgia,
in August 1938. She stepped off the train wearing a
pair of thick-soled boots suitable for hiking, a navy
blue dress, and a little white tam that rode the waves
of her red hair at a gravity-defying angle. August was
a hellish month to step off the train in Georgia,
although it was nothing, she said, compared to the
119 degrees that greeted her when she arrived one
time in Timbuktu, which, she assured us, was a real
place in Africa. I believe her remark irritated some of
the people gathered to welcome her on the burned
grass alongside the tracks. When folks are sweating
through their shorts, they don’t like to hear that this
is nothing compared to someplace else. Irritated or
not, the majority of those present were inclined to see
the arrival of the new schoolteacher in a positive
light. Hard times were still upon us in 1938, but, like
my momma said, “We weren’t no poorer than we’d
ever been,” and the citizens of Threestep were in the
mood for a little excitement.
Miss Spivey looked like just the right person to
give it to them. She was, by almost anyone’s
standards, a woman of the world. She’d gone to
boarding schools since she was six years old; she’d
studied French in Paris and drama in London; and
during what she called a “fruitful intermission” in her
formal education, she had traveled extensively in the

Near East and Africa with a friend of her
grandmother’s, one Janet Miller, who was a medical
doctor from Nashville, Tennessee. After her travels
with Dr. Miller, Miss Spivey continued her education
by attending Barnard College in New York City. She
told us all that at school the first day. When my little
brother Ralphord asked what did she study at
Barnyard College, Miss Spivey explained that
Barnard, which she wrote on the blackboard, was the
sister school of Columbia University, of which, she
expected, we all had heard.
It was there, she told us, in the midst of trying to
find her true mission in life, that she wandered one
afternoon into a lecture by the famous John Dewey,
who was talking about his famous book, Democracy
and Education. Professor Dewey was in his seventies
by then, Miss Spivey said, but he still liked to chat
with students after a lecture—especially female
students, she added—sometimes over coffee, and see
in their eyes the fire his words could kindle. It was
after this lecture and subsequent coffee that Miss
Spivey had marched to the Teacher’s College and
signed up, all aflame. Two years later, she told a
cheery blue-suited woman from the WPA1 that she
wanted to bring democracy and education to the
poorest, darkest, most remote and forgotten corner
of America.
They sent her to Threestep, Georgia.
Miss Spivey paused there for questions, avoiding
my brother Ralphord’s eye.
What we really wanted to know about—all
twenty-six of us across seven grade levels in the one
room—was the pearly white button hanging on a

string in front of the blackboard behind the teacher’s
desk up front. That button on a string was something
new. When Mavis Davis (the only bona fide seventh
grader, at age thirteen) asked what it was for, Miss
Spivey gave the string a tug, and to our astonishment,
the whole world—or at least a wrinkled map of
it—unfolded before our eyes. Her predecessor, Miss
Chandler, had never once made use of that map,
which was older than our fathers, and until that
moment, not a one of us knew it was there.
Miss Spivey showed us on the map how she and
Dr. Janet Miller had sailed across the Atlantic Ocean
and past the Rock of Gibraltar into the
Mediterranean Sea. Using the end of a ruler, she
gently tapped such places as Morocco and Tunis and
Algiers to mark their route along the top of Africa.
They spent twenty hours on the train to Baghdad, she
said, swathed in veils against the sand that crept in
every crack and crevice.
“And can you guess what we saw from the train?”
Miss Spivey asked. We could not. “Camels!” she said.
“We saw a whole caravan of camels.” She looked
around the room, waiting for us to be amazed and
delighted at the thought.
We all hung there for a minute, thinking hard,
until Mavis Davis spoke up.
“She means like the three kings rode to
Bethlehem,” Mavis said, and she folded her hands
smugly on her seventh-grade desk in the back of the
room.
Miss Spivey made a mistake right then. Instead of
beaming upon Mavis the kind of congratulatory
smile that old Miss Chandler would have bestowed
on her for having enlightened the rest of us, Miss
Spivey simply said, “That’s right.”

Building good transit isn’t a bad idea, but it can
actually backfire if the new trains and buses merely
clear space on highway lanes for those who would
prefer to drive—a group that, historically, has
included almost everyone with access to a car. To
have environmental value, new transit has to replace
and eliminate driving on a scale sufficient to cut
energy consumption overall. That means that a new
transit system has to be backed up by something that
impels complementary reductions in car use—say,
the physical elimination of traffic lanes or the
conversion of existing roadways into bike or bus
lanes, ideally in combination with higher fuel taxes,
parking fees, and tolls. Needless to say, those ideas
are not popular. But they’re necessary, because you
can’t make people drive less, in the long run, by
taking steps that make driving more pleasant,
economical, and productive.
One of the few forces with a proven ability to slow
the growth of suburban sprawl has been the
ultimately finite tolerance of commuters for long,
annoying commutes. That tolerance has grown in
recent decades, and not just in the United States, but
it isn’t unlimited, and even people who don’t seem to
mind spending half their day in a car eventually
reach a point where, finally, enough is enough. That
means that traffic congestion can have
environmental value, since it lengthens commuting
times and, by doing so, discourages the proliferation
of still more energy-hungry subdivisions—unless we
made the congestion go away. If, in a misguided
effort to do something of environmental value,
municipalities take steps that make long-distance car
commuting faster or more convenient—by adding
lanes, building bypasses, employing traffic-control

measures that make it possible for existing roads to
accommodate more cars with fewer delays, replacing
tollbooths with radio-based systems that don’t
require drivers even to slow down—we actually make
the sprawl problem worse, by indirectly encouraging
people to live still farther from their jobs, stores,
schools, and doctors’ offices, and by forcing
municipalities to further extend road networks,
power grids, water lines, and other civic
infrastructure. If you cut commuting time by
10 percent, people who now drive fifty miles each
way to work can justify moving five miles farther out,
because their travel time won’t change. This is how
metropolitan areas metastasize. It’s the history of
suburban expansion.
Traffic congestion isn’t an environmental
problem; traffic is. Relieving congestion without
doing anything to reduce the total volume of cars can
only make the real problem worse. Highway
engineers have known for a long time that building
new car lanes reduces congestion only temporarily,
because the new lanes foster additional driving—a
phenomenon called induced traffic. Widening roads
makes traffic move faster in the short term, but the
improved conditions eventually attract additional
drivers and entice current drivers to drive more, and
congestion reappears, but with more cars—and that
gets people thinking about widening roads again.
Moving drivers out of cars and into other forms of
transportation can have the same effect, if existing
traffic lanes are kept in service: road space begets
road use.
One of the arguments that cities inevitably make
in promoting transit plans is that the new system, by
relieving automobile congestion, will improve the
lives of those who continue to drive. No one ever
promotes a transit scheme by arguing that it would
make traveling less convenient—even though, from
an environmental perspective, inconvenient travel is
a worthy goal.

In the early 1990s, textbooks acknowledged that
humans had slow-conducting nerves, but asserted
that those nerves only responded to two types of
stimuli: pain and temperature. Sensations of pressure
and vibration were believed to travel only along
myelinated, fast-signaling nerve fibers, which also
give information about location. Experiments
blocking nerve fibers supported this notion.
Preventing fast fibers from firing (either by clamping
the relevant nerve or by injecting the local anesthetic
lidocaine) seemed to eliminate the sensation of
pressure altogether, but blocking slow fibers only
seemed to reduce sensitivity to warmth or a small
painful shock.
Håkan Olausson and his Gothenburg University
colleagues Åke Vallbo and Johan Wessberg
wondered if slow fibers responsive to gentle pressure
might be active in humans as well as in other
mammals. In 1993, they corralled 28 young
volunteers and recorded nerve signals while gently
brushing the subjects’ arms with their fingertips.
Using a technique called microneurography, in
which a fine filament is inserted into a single nerve to
capture its electrical impulses, the scientists were able
to measure how quickly—or slowly—the nerves
fired. They showed that soft stroking prompted
two different signals, one immediate and one
delayed. The delay, Olausson explains, means that
the signal from a gentle touch on the forearm will
reach the brain about a half second later. This delay
identified nerve impulses traveling at speeds
characteristic of slow, unmyelinated fibers—about
1 meter/second—confirming the presence of these
fibers in human hairy skin. (In contrast, fastconducting fibers, already known to respond to
touch, signal at a rate between 35 and 75 m/s.)
Then, in 1999, the group looked more closely at
the characteristics of the slow fibers. They named
these “low-threshold” nerves “C-tactile,” or CT,
fibers, said Olausson, because of their “exquisite
sensitivity” to slow, gentle tactile stimulation, but
unresponsiveness to noxious stimuli like pinpricks.
But why exactly humans might have such fibers,
which respond only to a narrow range of rather
subtle stimuli, was initially mystifying. Unlike other
types of sensory nerves, CT fibers could be found

only in hairy human skin—such as the forearm and
thigh. No amount of gentle stroking of hairless skin,
such as the palms and soles of the feet, prompted
similar activity signatures. Olausson and his
colleagues decided that these fibers must be
conveying a different dimension of sensory
information than fast-conducting fibers.
Although microneurography can give
information about how a single nerve responds to
gentle brushing and pressure, it cannot tease out
what aspect of sensation that fiber relays, says
Olausson. He wanted to know if that same slow
nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the
arm, and whether it can discern the difference
between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most
importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant
sensation?
To address the question, Olausson’s group sought
out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual
nerve defect. More than 2 decades earlier, she had
developed numbness across many parts of her body
after taking penicillin to treat a cough and fever.
Testing showed that she had lost responsiveness to
pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.’s
quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an
inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks
below her nose. But she could still sense warmth,
suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated
fibers were intact.
Upon recruiting G.L., Olausson tested her by
brushing her arm gently at the speed of between
2–10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble
distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush
strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a
pleasant sensation. When the researchers tried
brushing her palm, where CT fibers are not found,
she felt nothing.
Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine
which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.’s arm was
gently brushed to activate CT fibers. In normal
subjects, both the somatosensory and insular cortices
were activated, but only the insular cortex [which
processes emotion] was active when researchers
brushed G.L.’s arm. This solidified the notion that
CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch,
rather than the conscious aspect that helps us
describe what we are sensing. CT fibers, it seemed,
specifically provide pleasurable sensations.

Fellow-Citizens: It is a noble land that God has
given us; a land that can feed and clothe the world; a
land whose coast lines would enclose half the
countries of Europe; a land set like a sentinel between
the two imperial oceans of the globe; a greater
England with a nobler destiny. It is a mighty people
that He has planted on this soil; a people sprung
from the most masterful blood of history; a people
perpetually revitalized by the virile . . . working-folk
of all the earth; a people imperial by virtue of their
power, by right of their institutions, by authority of
their heaven-directed purposes—the propagandists
and not the misers of liberty. It is a glorious history
our God has bestowed upon His chosen people; a
history whose keynote was struck by Liberty Bell; a
history heroic with faith in our mission and our
future; a history of statesmen, who flung the
boundaries of the Republic out into unexplored
lands . . . a history of soldiers, who carried the flag
across blazing deserts and through the ranks of
hostile mountains, even to the gates of sunset; a
history of a multiplying people, who overran a
continent in half a century . . . a history divinely
logical, in the process of whose tremendous
reasoning we find ourselves to-day. . . .
Think of the thousands of Americans who will
pour into Hawaii and Porto Rico when the
Republic’s laws cover those islands with justice and
safety! Think of the tens of thousands of Americans
who will invade . . . the Philippines when a liberal
government . . . shall establish order and equity
there! Think of the hundreds of thousands of
Americans who will build a . . . civilization of energy
and industry in Cuba, when a government of law
replaces the double reign of anarchy and tyranny!—
think of the prosperous millions that Empress of
Islands will support when, obedient to the law of
political gravitation, her people ask for the highest
honor liberty can bestow, the sacred Order of the
Stars and Stripes, the citizenship of the Great
Republic!

If it is right for the United States to hold the
Philippine Islands permanently and imitate
European empires in the government of colonies, the
Republican party ought to state its position and
defend it, but it must expect the subject races to
protest against such a policy and to resist to the
extent of their ability.
The Filipinos do not need any encouragement
from Americans now living. Our whole history has
been an encouragement not only to the Filipinos, but
to all who are denied a voice in their own
government. If the Republicans are prepared to
censure all who have used language calculated to
make the Filipinos hate foreign domination, let them
condemn the speech of Patrick Henry. When he
uttered that passionate appeal, “Give me liberty or
give me death,” he exprest a sentiment which still
echoes in the hearts of men.
Let them censure Jefferson; of all the statesmen of
history none have used words so offensive to those
who would hold their fellows in political bondage.
Let them censure Washington, who declared that the
colonists must choose between liberty and slavery.
Or, if the statute of limitations has run against
the sins of Henry and Jefferson and Washington, let
them censure Lincoln, whose Gettysburg speech will
be quoted in defense of popular government when
the present advocates of force and conquest are
forgotten.
Some one has said that a truth once spoken can
never be recalled. It goes on and on, and no one can
set a limit to its ever-widening influence. But if it
were possible to obliterate every word written or
spoken in defense of the principles set forth in the
Declaration of Independence, a war of conquest
would still leave its legacy of perpetual hatred, for it
was God himself who placed in every human heart
the love of liberty. He never made a race of people so
low in the scale of civilization or intelligence that it
would welcome a foreign master.
Those who would have this Nation enter upon a
career of empire must consider, not only the effect of
imperialism on the Filipinos, but they must also
calculate its effects upon our own nation. We cannot
repudiate the principle of self-government in the
Philippines without weakening that principle here.

Many millennia before the invention of
herbicides, farmers simply plowed their fields to
control weeds. Even today, plowing can constitute a
valuable part of an integrated weed-management
program. Although plowing kills standing weeds,
farmers have long known that it often leads to the
emergence of new weed seedlings in a few weeks.
Ecologists have shown that a farmer’s field can
have 50,000 or more weed seeds per square meter
buried beneath the soil surface. Plant physiologists
have shown that seeds buried more than about one
centimeter below the soil surface do not receive
enough light to germinate. Do the blades of a plow,
which can reach more than a foot beneath the soil
surface, bring some of these buried seeds to the
surface where their germination is induced by
exposure to sunlight?
Two ecologists, Jonathan Sauer and Gwendolyn
Struik, began to study this question in the 1960s. In a
relatively simple experiment, they went to ten
different habitats in Wisconsin during the night and
collected pairs of soil samples. They stirred up the
soil in one sample of each pair in the light and stirred
up the other sample of each pair in the dark. They then
exposed all ten pairs to natural sunlight in a
greenhouse. For nine of the ten pairs of soil samples,
weed growth was greater in the samples stirred up in
light. They concluded that soil disturbance gives
weed seeds a “light break,” and this stimulates their
germination.
More recently, Karl Hartmann of Erlangen
University in Germany reasoned that when farmers
plowed their fields during the day, the buried weed
seeds are briefly exposed to sunlight as the soil is
turned over, and that this stimulates their
germination. Although the light exposures from
plowing may be less than one millisecond, that can
be enough to induce seed germination. Thus the
germination of weed seeds would be minimized if
farmers simply plowed their fields during the night,
when the photon fluence rate [the rate at which
photons hit the surface] is below 1015 photons per
square meter per second. Although even under these

conditions hundreds of millions of photons strike
each square millimeter of ground each second, this
illumination is below the threshold needed to
stimulate the germination of most seeds.
Hartmann says that he was very skeptical when
he first came up with this idea because he assumed
that such a simple method of weed control as
plowing at nighttime must be ineffective or it would
have been discovered long ago. But the subsequent
experiments, first presented at a 1989 scientific
meeting in Freiburg, Germany, clearly demonstrated
that the method can be effective.
Hartmann tested his idea by plowing two
agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany.
The farmer Karl Seydel cultivated one strip, repeated
threefold, at around midday and the other strip
at night. No crops were planted in these pilot
experiments, to avoid possible competition with
the emerging weeds. The results were dramatic.
More than 80 percent of the surface of the field
plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas
only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was
covered by weeds.
This method of weed control is currently being
used by several farmers in Germany. Because many
of the same weed species that invade farmers’ fields
in Germany also invade fields elsewhere in the world,
this method should be successful elsewhere. In fact,
recent studies at universities in Nebraska, Oregon,
Minnesota, Denmark, Sweden, and Argentina
support this idea.

How a Cat in a Hat Changed Children’s Education
In a 1954 Life magazine article, author John Hersey
expressed concern that children in the United States were
disengaged from learning how to read. Among other
problems, Hersey noted, the reading material available to
grade-schoolers had a hard time competing with
television, radio, 1 and other media for children’s
attention. One solution he proposed was to make

The story of The Cat in the Hat’s publication began
when William 3 Spaulding, the director of the
education division at the publishing company
Houghton Mifflin, read Hersey’s article and had an idea.
Spaulding agreed that there was a need for appealing
books for beginning 4 readers. He thought he knew
who should write one. He arranged to have dinner with
Theodor Geisel, who wrote and illustrated children’s
books under the name “Dr. Seuss,” and issued him a
challenge: “Write me a story that first graders can’t put

having maintained a professional relationship with him,
Geisel was an experienced writer and illustrator.
6 However, this new project presented him with an
obstacle. Spaulding told Geisel to write his entire book
using a restricted vocabulary from an elementary school
list of 348 words. Geisel started two stories, only to
abandon them when he found that he needed to use
words that were not on the list. On the verge of giving up,
7 Geisel’s story finally hit upon an image that became
its basis: a cat wearing a battered stovepipe hat. His main
character established, Geisel commenced the difficult task
of writing a book with a limited vocabulary. 8 At the
end of a duration nine months long, The Cat in the Hat
was complete.

Keep Student Volunteering Voluntary
A growing number of public schools in the
United States require students to complete community
service hours to graduate. Such volunteering, be it
helping at a local animal shelter, 12 when they pick up
litter, or working at a health-care facility, has obvious
benefits for the community it serves and teaches students
important life skills. But critics say that making
volunteerism compulsory misses the point of the act.
13 By its very definition, volunteer work is done
willingly. By requiring students to do community service
in order to graduate, school 14 officials’ are taking away
students’ choice to give up their time for nonprofit
activities, making volunteerism less meaningful and
pleasurable. According to a psychological concept called
the reactance theory, the loss of freedom in choosing an
activity can cause a negative reaction. For instance,
instead of focusing on the good they are doing, students
may become resentful of the demands that compulsory
volunteering places on their schedules.

volunteer in general, not making a distinction between

Sara E. Helms, assistant professor of economics at
Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, did focus
specifically on 18 mandatory volunteering. She found
that students who were required to volunteer rushed to
complete their service hours in early high 19 school,
they then did significantly less regular volunteer work in
the twelfth grade 20 than the service hours of those not
required to volunteer. Helms concluded that compulsory
volunteering does not necessarily create lifelong
volunteers.

Marsupials (mammals that carry their young in a
pouch) are a curiosity among biologists because they lack
a corpus callosum, the collection of nerve fibers
connecting the two hemispheres of the brain. In most
other mammals, the left hemisphere of the brain controls
the right side of the body, the right hemisphere controls
the left, and the corpus callosum allows communication
between the hemispheres. Scientists 23 are long
believing that this structure enables complex tasks by
sequestering skilled movement to a single hemisphere
without sacrificing coordination between both sides of
the body; this sequestration would explain handedness,
the tendency to consistently prefer 24 one hand over the
other, in humans. However, a recent finding of
handedness in marsupials suggests that a 25 trait other
than the presence of a corpus callosum 26 links as
handedness: bipedalism.

the University of Tasmania observed marsupials walking
on either two legs (bipeds) or four (quadrupeds) and
performing tasks such as bringing food to their mouths.
The scientists employed a mean handedness index;
27 negative scores indicated a left-forelimb preference
and positive scores indicated a right-forelimb preference.
While eating, the eastern gray kangaroo, red-necked
wallaby, red 28 kangaroo and, brush-tailed bettong, all
bipedal marsupials, preferred using their left forelimb, as
revealed by 29 positive mean handedness index values
less than 0.2 for all four species. These results suggest
handedness among these animals.

researchers noted, the quadrupeds typically live in trees
and employ all four limbs in climbing. The bipeds, on the
other hand, are far less arboreal, leaving their forelimbs
relatively free for tasks in 32 whom handedness may
confer an evolutionary advantage. Why the majority of
marsupials studied preferred their left forelimbs while the
majority of humans prefer their right remains a mystery,
however, 33 as does the mechanism by which, in the
absence of a corpus callosum, the hemispheres of the
marsupial brain communicate.

An Employee Benefit That Benefits Employers

According to a 2014 report from the Society for
Human Resource Management, 54 percent of surveyed
companies provide tuition assistance to employees
pursuing an undergraduate degree, and 50 percent do so
for employees working toward a graduate degree.
34 Despite these findings, more companies should
consider helping employees pay for education because
doing so helps 35 increase customer satisfaction and
improve the quality of the companies’ business.

Tuition-reimbursement programs signal that
employers offer their 36 workers’ opportunities for
personal and professional development. According to
professor of management Peter Cappelli, such
opportunities are appealing to highly motivated and
disciplined individuals and may attract applicants with
these desirable qualities. Many in the business
community concur. Explaining his company’s decision to
expand its tuition-assistance program, John Fox, the
director of dealer training at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles
in the United States, 37 who stressed the importance of
drawing skilled employees to Fiat Chrysler’s car
dealerships: “This is a benefit that can surely bring top
talent to our dealers,” he said.

Paying for tuition also helps businesses retain
38 employees. Retaining employees is important not
only because it ensures a skilled and experienced
workforce but also because it mitigates the considerable
costs of finding, hiring, and training new workers.
Employees whose tuition is reimbursed often stay with
their employer even after they complete their
39 degrees. Because their new qualifications give them
opportunities for advancement within the company. The
career of Valerie Lincoln, an employee at the aerospace
company United Technologies Corporation 40 (UTC)
is a significant success story for her company’s
tuition‑reimbursement program. In eight years at UTC,
Lincoln earned associate and bachelor’s degrees in
business and advanced from an administrative assistant
position to an accounting associate position. This allowed
UTC to retain an employee with a 41 deep knowledge of
her industry and years of valuable experience.

Tuition reimbursement can be expensive, and many
companies would find it impractical to pay for multiple
degrees for all employees. Businesses have succeeded in
42 minimizing and keeping down costs and ensuring
the relevance of employees’ coursework by offering fixed
amounts of reimbursement each year and stipulating
which subjects workers can study. Even with these
methods, tuition reimbursement may not be appropriate
in all cases, especially if classes are likely 43 to divert
employees’ time and energy from their jobs.
