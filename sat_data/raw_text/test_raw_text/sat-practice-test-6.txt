About the Practice Test

Take the practice test, which starts on the next page,
to reinforce your test-taking skills and to be more
comfortable when you take the SAT. This practice
test will give you a good idea of what to expect on
the actual test.
In addition, once you take the test you can go to
sat.org/practicetests for a scoring guide to check your
answers and get answer explanations.
You’ll need to set aside 3 hours and 15 minutes to take
the test.

Approaches to the
Practice Test

The practice test will help you more if you take it under
conditions as close as possible to those of the actual test.

 Plan to complete the entire test in one sitting.
 The Reading Test takes 65 minutes, followed
by a 10-minute break.

 The Writing and Language Test is 35 minutes
long, followed immediately (no break) by
the Math Test – No Calculator, which takes
25 minutes.



Allow yourself a 5-minute break, and then
take the Math Test – Calculator, which is
55 minutes long.

 Pace yourself by using a watch (without an
audible alarm).

 Sit at a desk or table cleared of any other papers

or books. Don’t use any prohibited items such as
a dictionary, notes, or scratch paper.

 Use an acceptable calculator that is familiar to
you for the Math Test – Calculator. Check our
calculator policies at sat.org/calculator.

 Read the test directions carefully.

Marking the Answer Sheet

Getting credit for the right answer depends on
marking the answer sheet correctly. When filling out
your answer sheet, whether for the practice test or on
test day, follow these important instructions:

 Make sure you use a No. 2 pencil.
 Fill in the entire bubble on the answer sheet darkly
and completely.

 If you change your response, erase it as completely
as possible.

Calculating Your Scores

The scoring guide at sat.org/practicetests shows how
your test should be scored: by counting the questions
you answered correctly and converting this “raw” score
to a score on the College Board scale of 200 to 800.

Evaluate Your Test
Performance

Once you've scored your practice test, review your
performance and ask yourself these questions:

 Did I run out of time before I finished a section?
Remember, all multiple-choice questions are
scored the same way. Be prepared to keep moving
on test day and don’t spend too much time on any
one question.

 Did I make careless mistakes? You may have

misread a question, neglected to notice a word such
as “except” or “best,” or solved for the wrong value.
Recognizing these small but critical errors will help
you avoid them on test day.

 Did I spend too much time reading directions?

Review any directions that gave you trouble so you
don’t have to spend as much time reading them
when you take the actual test.

 Keep learning and practicing at satpractice.org.

Another man might have thrown up his
hands—but not Nawabdin. His twelve daughters
acted as a spur to his genius, and he looked with
satisfaction in the mirror each morning at the face of
a warrior going out to do battle. Nawab of course
knew that he must proliferate his sources of
revenue—the salary he received from K. K. Harouni
for tending the tube wells would not even begin to
suffice. He set up a little one-room flour mill, run off
a condemned electric motor—condemned by him.
He tried his hand at fish-farming in a little pond at
the edge of his master’s fields. He bought broken
radios, fixed them, and resold them. He did not
demur even when asked to fix watches, though that
enterprise did spectacularly badly, and in fact earned
him more kicks than kudos, for no watch he took
apart ever kept time again.
K. K. Harouni rarely went to his farms, but lived
mostly in Lahore. Whenever the old man visited,
Nawab would place himself night and day at the door
leading from the servants’ sitting area into the walled
grove of ancient banyan trees where the old
farmhouse stood. Grizzled, his peculiar aviator

glasses bent and smudged, Nawab tended the
household machinery, the air conditioners, water
heaters, refrigerators, and water pumps, like an
engineer tending the boilers on a foundering steamer
in an Atlantic gale. By his superhuman efforts he
almost managed to maintain K. K. Harouni in the
same mechanical cocoon, cooled and bathed and
lighted and fed, that the landowner enjoyed in
Lahore.
Harouni of course became familiar with this
ubiquitous man, who not only accompanied him on
his tours of inspection, but morning and night could
be found standing on the master bed rewiring the
light fixture or in the bathroom poking at the water
heater. Finally, one evening at teatime, gauging the
psychological moment, Nawab asked if he might say
a word. The landowner, who was cheerfully filing his
nails in front of a crackling rosewood fire, told him
to go ahead.
“Sir, as you know, your lands stretch from here to
the Indus, and on these lands are fully seventeen tube
wells, and to tend these seventeen tube wells there is
but one man, me, your servant. In your service I have
earned these gray hairs”—here he bowed his head to
show the gray—“and now I cannot fulfill my duties
as I should. Enough, sir, enough. I beg you, forgive
me my weakness. Better a darkened house and proud
hunger within than disgrace in the light of day.
Release me, I ask you, I beg you.”
The old man, well accustomed to these sorts of
speeches, though not usually this florid, filed away at
his nails and waited for the breeze to stop.
“What’s the matter, Nawabdin?”

“Matter, sir? O what could be the matter in your
service. I’ve eaten your salt for all my years. But sir,
on the bicycle now, with my old legs, and with the
many injuries I’ve received when heavy machinery
fell on me—I cannot any longer bicycle about like a
bridegroom from farm to farm, as I could when I
first had the good fortune to enter your employment.
I beg you, sir, let me go.”
“And what’s the solution?” asked Harouni, seeing
that they had come to the crux. He didn’t particularly
care one way or the other, except that it touched on
his comfort—a matter of great interest to him.
“Well, sir, if I had a motorcycle, then I could
somehow limp along, at least until I train up some
younger man.”
The crops that year had been good, Harouni felt
expansive in front of the fire, and so, much to the
disgust of the farm managers, Nawab received a
brand-new motorcycle, a Honda 70. He even
managed to extract an allowance for gasoline.
The motorcycle increased his status, gave him
weight, so that people began calling him “Uncle,” and
asking his opinion on world affairs, about which he
knew absolutely nothing. He could now range
further, doing a much wider business. Best of all,
now he could spend every night with his wife, who
had begged to live not on the farm but near her
family in Firoza, where also they could educate at
least the two eldest daughters. A long straight road
ran from the canal headworks near Firoza all the way
to the Indus, through the heart of the K. K. Harouni
lands. Nawab would fly down this road on his new
machine, with bags and cloths hanging from every
knob and brace, so that the bike, when he hit a bump,
seemed to be flapping numerous small vestigial
wings; and with his grinning face, as he rolled up to
whichever tube well needed servicing, with his ears
almost blown off, he shone with the speed of his
arrival.

The news is a form of public knowledge.
Unlike personal or private knowledge (such as the
health of one’s friends and family; the conduct of a
private hobby; a secret liaison), public knowledge
increases in value as it is shared by more people. The
date of an election and the claims of rival candidates;
the causes and consequences of an environmental
disaster; a debate about how to frame a particular
law; the latest reports from a war zone—these are all
examples of public knowledge that people are
generally expected to know in order to be considered
informed citizens. Thus, in contrast to personal or
private knowledge, which is generally left to
individuals to pursue or ignore, public knowledge is
promoted even to those who might not think it
matters to them. In short, the circulation of public
knowledge, including the news, is generally regarded
as a public good which cannot be solely
demand-driven.
The production, circulation, and reception
of public knowledge is a complex process. It is
generally accepted that public knowledge should
be authoritative, but there is not always
common agreement about what the public needs to
know, who is best placed to relate and explain it, and
how authoritative reputations should be determined
and evaluated. Historically, newspapers such as The
Times and broadcasters such as the BBC were widely
regarded as the trusted shapers of authoritative
agendas and conventional wisdom. They embodied
the Oxford English Dictionary’s definition of
authority as the “power over, or title to influence, the
opinions of others.” As part of the general process of
the transformation of authority whereby there has
been a reluctance to uncritically accept traditional
sources of public knowledge, the demand has been
for all authority to make explicit the frames of value
which determine their decisions. Centres of news
production, as our focus groups show, have not been
exempt from this process. Not surprisingly perhaps
some news journalists feel uneasy about this
renegotiation of their authority:

Editors are increasingly casting a glance at the
“most read” lists on their own and other websites
to work out which stories matter to readers and
viewers. And now the audience—which used to
know its place—is being asked to act as a kind of
journalistic ombudsman, ruling on our
credibility (broadcast journalist, 2008).
The result of democratising access to TV news
could be political disengagement by the majority
and a dumbing down through a popularity
contest of stories (online news editor, 2007).
Despite the rhetorical bluster of these statements,
they amount to more than straightforward
professional defensiveness. In their reference to an
audience “which used to know its place” and
conflation between democratisation and “dumbing
down,” they are seeking to argue for a particular
mode of public knowledge: one which is shaped by
experts, immune from populist pressures; and
disseminated to attentive, but mainly passive
recipients. It is a view of citizenship that closes down
opportunities for popular involvement in the making
of public knowledge by reinforcing the professional
claims of experts. The journalists quoted above are
right to feel uneasy, for there is, at almost every
institutional level in contemporary society,
scepticism towards the epistemological authority of
expert elites. There is a growing feeling, as expressed
by several of our focus group participants, that the
news media should be “informative rather than
authoritative”; the job of journalists should be to
“give the news as raw as it is, without putting their
slant on it”; and people should be given “sufficient
information” from which “we would be able to form
opinions of our own.”
At stake here are two distinct conceptions of
authority. The journalists we have quoted are
resistant to the democratisation of news:
the supremacy of the clickstream (according to
which editors raise or lower the profile of stories
according to the number of readers clicking on them
online); the parity of popular culture with “serious”
news; the demands of some audience members for
raw news rather than constructed narratives.

Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared
blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they
close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy
aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle
pollen from flower to flower. But “when you
advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an
open communication network,” says chemical
ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for
Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just
the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For
a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are
among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and
petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the
dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can
reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in
mere days.
In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler
took on the specific problem of the Texas
gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not
too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main
pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash
bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma
includes 10 compounds, but the most
abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees
into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should
be even more appealing to bees. “We have this
assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to
attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical
ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,
Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really
been tested—and extra scent could well call in more
beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted
168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,
throughout the August flowering season, made half
the plants more fragrant by tucking
dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their
flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times
more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of
the plants got swabs without fragrance.

The researchers also wanted to know whether
extra beetles would impose a double cost by both
damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might
not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with
other insects and their feces. So every half hour
throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the
beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and
half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to
the blossoms with and without interference by
beetles.
Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female
flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance
and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop
into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,
providing a benchmark to see whether the
fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles
resulted in reduced pollination.
“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis.
“We would be out there at four in the morning, three
in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers
open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next
several hours walking from flower to flower,
observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing
down everything we saw.”
What they saw was double the normal number of
beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms.
Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the
highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,
and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often
than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were
repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the
abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more
beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to
visit it.
That added up to less reproduction for
fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed
from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,
on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal
flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,
indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly
—regardless of whether they also repelled
pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit
weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that
lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.)

The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd
plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If

Let every American, every lover of liberty, every
well wisher to his posterity, swear by the blood of the
Revolution, never to violate in the least particular,
the laws of the country; and never to tolerate their
violation by others. As the patriots of seventy-six did
to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so
to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every
American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred
honor;—let every man remember that to violate the
law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to
tear the character of his own, and his children’s
liberty. Let reverence for the laws, be breathed by
every American mother, to the lisping babe, that
prattles on her lap—let it be taught in schools, in
seminaries, and in colleges;—let it be written in
Primers, spelling books, and in Almanacs;—let it be
preached from the pulpit, proclaimed in legislative
halls, and enforced in courts of justice. And, in short,
let it become the political religion of the nation;
and let the old and the young, the rich and the poor,
the grave and the gay, of all sexes and tongues, and
colors and conditions, sacrifice unceasingly upon its
altars. . . .
When I so pressingly urge a strict observance of
all the laws, let me not be understood as saying there
are no bad laws, nor that grievances may not arise,
for the redress of which, no legal provisions have
been made. I mean to say no such thing. But I do
mean to say, that, although bad laws, if they exist,
should be repealed as soon as possible, still while they
continue in force, for the sake of example, they
should be religiously observed. So also in unprovided
cases. If such arise, let proper legal provisions be
made for them with the least possible delay; but, till
then, let them if not too intolerable, be borne with.

There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress
by mob law. In any case that arises, as for instance,
the promulgation of abolitionism, one of two
positions is necessarily true; that is, the thing is right
within itself, and therefore deserves the protection of
all law and all good citizens; or, it is wrong, and
therefore proper to be prohibited by legal
enactments; and in neither case, is the interposition
of mob law, either necessary, justifiable, or excusable.

Unjust laws exist; shall we be content to obey
them, or shall we endeavor to amend them, and obey
them until we have succeeded, or shall we transgress
them at once? Men generally, under such a
government as this, think that they ought to wait
until they have persuaded the majority to alter them.
They think that, if they should resist, the remedy
would be worse than the evil. But it is the fault of the
government itself that the remedy is worse than the
evil. It makes it worse. Why is it not more apt to
anticipate and provide for reform? Why does it not
cherish its wise minority? Why does it cry and resist
before it is hurt? . . .
If the injustice is part of the necessary friction of
the machine of government, let it go, let it go;
perchance it will wear smooth—certainly the
machine will wear out. If the injustice has a spring, or
a pulley, or a rope, or a crank, exclusively for itself,
then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy
will not be worse than the evil; but if it is of such a
nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice
to another, then, I say, break the law. Let your life be
a counter friction to stop the machine. What I have
to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to
the wrong which I condemn.
As for adopting the ways which the State has
provided for remedying the evil, I know not of such
ways. They take too much time, and a man’s life will
be gone. I have other affairs to attend to. I came into
this world, not chiefly to make this a good place to
live in, but to live in it, be it good or bad. A man has
not everything to do, but something; and because he
cannot do everything, it is not necessary that he
should do something wrong. . . .

I do not hesitate to say, that those who call
themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually
withdraw their support, both in person and property,
from the government . . . and not wait till they
constitute a majority of one, before they suffer the
right to prevail through them. I think that it is
enough if they have God on their side, without
waiting for that other one. Moreover, any man more
right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one
already.

Solar panel installations continue to grow quickly,
but the solar panel manufacturing industry is in the
doldrums because supply far exceeds demand. The
poor market may be slowing innovation, but
advances continue; judging by the mood this week at
the IEEE Photovoltaics Specialists Conference in
Tampa, Florida, people in the industry remain
optimistic about its long-term prospects.
The technology that’s surprised almost everyone
is conventional crystalline silicon. A few years ago,
silicon solar panels cost $4 per watt, and
Martin Green, professor at the University of
New South Wales and one of the leading silicon solar
panel researchers, declared that they’d never go
below $1 a watt. “Now it’s down to something like
50 cents a watt, and there’s talk of hitting 36 cents per
watt,” he says.
The U.S. Department of Energy has set a goal of
reaching less than $1 a watt—not just for the solar
panels, but for complete, installed systems—by 2020.
Green thinks the solar industry will hit that target
even sooner than that. If so, that would bring the
direct cost of solar power to six cents per
kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper than the average cost
expected for power from new natural gas power
plants.
All parts of the silicon solar panel industry have
been looking for ways to cut costs and improve the
power output of solar panels, and that’s led to steady
cost reductions. Green points to something as
mundane as the pastes used to screen-print some of
the features on solar panels. Green’s lab built a solar
cell in the 1990s that set a record efficiency for silicon
solar cells—a record that stands to this day. To
achieve that record, he had to use expensive
lithography techniques to make fine wires for
collecting current from the solar cell. But gradual
improvements have made it possible to use screen
printing to produce ever-finer lines. Recent research
suggests that screen-printing techniques can produce
lines as thin as 30 micrometers—about the width of
the lines Green used for his record solar cells, but at
costs far lower than his lithography techniques.

Meanwhile, researchers at the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory have made flexible solar cells on a
new type of glass from Corning called Willow Glass,
which is thin and can be rolled up. The type of solar
cell they made is the only current challenger to
silicon in terms of large-scale production—thin-film
cadmium telluride. Flexible solar cells could lower
the cost of installing solar cells, making solar power
cheaper.
One of Green’s former students and colleagues,
Jianhua Zhao, cofounder of solar panel manufacturer
China Sunergy, announced this week that he is
building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided
solar cell that can absorb light from both the front
and back. The basic idea, which isn’t new, is that
during some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the
land between rows of solar panels in a solar power
plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels
and could be harvested to increase the power output.
This works particularly well when the solar panels
are built on sand, which is highly reflective. Where a
one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a
two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts. He
expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more
electricity over the course of a year.
Even longer-term, Green is betting on silicon,
aiming to take advantage of the huge reductions in
cost already seen with the technology. He hopes to
greatly increase the efficiency of silicon solar panels
by combining silicon with one or two other
semiconductors, each selected to efficiently convert a
part of the solar spectrum that silicon doesn’t convert
efficiently. Adding one semiconductor could boost
efficiencies from the 20 to 25 percent range to
around 40 percent. Adding another could make
efficiencies as high as 50 percent feasible, which
would cut in half the number of solar panels needed
for a given installation. The challenge is to produce
good connections between these semiconductors,
something made challenging by the arrangement of
silicon atoms in crystalline silicon.

compose Canada’s remotely located Experimental Lakes

A Little to the Left, but Not Too Much!
Italy’s Tower of Pisa has been leaning southward
since the initial 12 stages of it’s construction over
800 years ago. 13 Indeed, if the tower’s construction had
not taken two centuries and involved significant breaks
due to war and civil unrest, which allowed the ground
beneath the tower to settle, the tower would likely have
collapsed before it was completed.

managed to achieve. The committee’s first attempt to
reduce the angle of the tower’s tilt—placing 600 tons of
iron ingots (molded pieces of metal) on the tower’s north
side to create a counterweight—was derided because the
bulky weights ruined the tower’s appearance. The
attempt at a less visible solution—sinking anchors into
the ground below the tower—almost caused the tower to
fall.

a geotechnical engineer from England who saved
London’s clock tower Big Ben from collapse. [2] Burland
began a years-long process of drilling out small amounts
of soil from under the tower 20 that took several years to
complete and then monitoring the tower’s resulting
movement. [3] Twice daily, Burland evaluated these
movements and made recommendations as to how much
soil should be removed in the next drilling. [4] By 2001,
almost 77 tons of soil had been removed, and the tower’s
tilt had decreased by over 1.5 degrees; the ugly iron
weights were removed, and the tower was reopened to
visitors. [5] Burland 21 advocated using soil extraction:
removing small amounts of soil from under the tower’s
north side, opposite its tilt, to enable gravity to straighten
the tower. 22
The tower’s tilt has not increased since, and the
committee is confident that the tower will be safe for
another 200 years. Burland is now working on a more
permanent solution for keeping the tower upright, but he
is adamant that the tower never be completely
straightened. In an interview with PBS’s Nova, Burland
explained that it is very important “that we don’t really
change the character of the monument. That would be
quite wrong and quite inappropriate.”

The Physician Assistant Will See You Now
23 The term “paramedics” refers to health care
workers who provide routine and clinical services. While
the pressures of an aging population, insurance reforms,
and health epidemics have increased demand for care, the
supply of physicians is not expected to 24 keep pace.
The Association of American Medical Colleges predicts a
shortage of over 90,000 physicians by 2020; by 2025, that
number could climb to more than 130,000. In some parts
of the country, shortages are already a sad fact of life. A
2009 report by the Bureau of Health Professions notes
that although a fifth of the US population lives in rural
areas, less than a tenth of US physicians serves that
population. Because a traditionalist response to the
crisis— 25 amping up medical-college enrollments and
expanding physician training programs—is too slow and
costly to address the near-term problem, alternatives are
being explored. One promising avenue has been greater
reliance on physician assistants (PAs).

training period for PAs is markedly shorter than
30 those for physicians—two to three years versus the
seven to eleven required for physicians.
Physician assistants already offer vital primary care
in many locations. Some 90,000 PAs were employed
nationwide in 2012. Over and above their value in
partially compensating for the general physician shortage
has been their extraordinary contribution to rural health
care. A recent review of the scholarly literature by
Texas researchers found that PAs lend cost-efficient,
widely appreciated services in underserved areas.
31 In addition, rural-based PAs often provide a broader
spectrum of such services than do their urban and
suburban counterparts, possibly as a consequence of the
limited pool of rural-based physicians.

Gold into Silver: The “Reverse Alchemy” of Superhero
Comics History
34 Popular film franchises are often “rebooted” in
an effort to make their characters and stories fresh and
relevant for new audiences. Superhero comic books are
periodically reworked to try to increase their appeal to
contemporary readers. This practice is almost as
35 elderly as the medium itself and has in large part
established the “ages” that compose comic book history.
The shift from the Golden to the Silver Age is probably
the most successful 36 example: of publishers
responding to changing times and tastes.

often dated to 1938 with the debut of Superman in Action
Comics #1. Besides beginning the age, Superman in many
respects defined it, becoming the model on which many
later superheroes were based. His characterization, as
established in Superman #1 (1939), was relatively simple.
He could “hurdle skyscrapers” and “leap an eighth of a
mile”; “run faster than a streamline train”; withstand
anything less than a “bursting shell”; and 37 lift a car
over his head. Sent to Earth from the “doomed planet”
Krypton, he was raised by human foster parents, whose
love helped infuse him with an unapologetic desire to
“benefit mankind.” Admirable but aloof, the Golden Age
Superman was arguably more paragon than character, a
problem only partially solved by giving him a human
alter ego. Other Golden Age superheroes were similarly
archetypal: Batman was a crime-fighting millionaire,
Wonder Woman a warrior princess from a mythical
island.

stories often involving scientific experiments gone wrong.
In addition to super villains, the new, soon-to-be-iconic
characters of the 39 age: Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four,
and the Hulk among them—had to cope with mundane,
real-life problems, including paying the rent, dealing with
family squabbles, and facing anger, loneliness, and
ostracism. Their interior lives were richer and their
motivations more complex. Although sales remained
strong for Golden Age stalwarts Superman and, to a
lesser extent, Batman, 40 subsequent decades would
show the enduring appeal of these characters.

When designing a stairway, an architect can use the
riser-tread formula 2h + d = 25, where h is the riser
height, in inches, and d is the tread depth, in inches. For
any given stairway, the riser heights are the same and the
tread depths are the same for all steps in that stairway.
The number of steps in a stairway is the number of its
risers. For example, there are 5 steps in the stairway in
the figure above. The total rise of a stairway is the sum of
the riser heights as shown in the figure.
