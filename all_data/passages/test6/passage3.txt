Near  the  end  of  his  eight  years  as  a  recording- session  musician,  tenor  saxophonist  
Leon  “Chu”  Berry landed  a  short-lived  spot  with  Count  Basie's  orchestra. Standing  in  for 
 one  of  the  Basie  band’s  two  tenor
 giants,  Berry  took  a  lead  solo on  “Oh,  Lady  Be  Good,” the  19Gershwin  song  that  
B asie  had  played  for years.   In   the    seconds   that   the   solo   lasted   on 
February  4,  1939,  we  are  treated  to  no  less  than  the musical  personification  of   mind  
and  body   working
together  in divine tandem. When you  hear the recording for  the  first  time,  you're  likely 
 to  wonder  why  you've never heard of  Chu Berry  before.

Why  you've  never  heard  of  him is  pretty  simple:  a lot of  hard-core  jazz  buffs don’t know 
 much  about  him.
Berry   was  a  solid  session   player   who  turns   up  on recordings     with    Basie,    
Bessie    Smith,    Fletcher Henderson,  and Billie  Holiday.  But he did  not cut many sessions  
himself  as  a  leader,  and  when  he  soloed,  he worked  within  the  recording  constraints  of 
 the  era  and
the swing genre—fast-moving 78s with solos often last- ing for a mere 32 beats.

The  people  who  loved  Berry  were,  not  surpris- ingly,  other  tenor  players,  a  situation  
leading  to  the dreaded   “musician's   musician”   tag.   But   that's   not
nearly  praise enough  to describe  Chu  Berry,  who,  when given  opportunity,  displayed  a  
musical  dexterity  that would  be envied  by future generations  of  horn  men.

Berry faced  the lot of  other horn players: having to grind  it  out  long  and  hard  until  
something  memorable
burst  through;  the  prejudices  and  expectations  of  the listening  public;  and  the  
accepted  wisdom  of  what  is and  isn’I art in  a given  medium.  In  this case, swing  was 
fodder for dance parties,  not music  worthy of  study.
Oddly   enough,   Berry's   geniality    might   help
explain  his  failure  to  court  history's  favor:  it  wasn’t  in his  nature  to  call  
attention  to  himself   or  his  playing. Born  in  19into  the  black  middle  class  in  
Wheeling, West  Virginia,  the  laid-back,  affable  Berry  attended West  Virginia  State  in  
Charleston,  where  he  switched
from  alto  sax  to  tenor  and  exhibited  the  willingness  to fit  in  that  characterized  
his  presence  in  so  many  dance bands.  He  was  the  rare  artist  who  refused  to  put  his 
interests  above  those  of  the  band,  even  if  that  meant playing  ensemble  passages  rather  
than  taking  a  healthy
allotment of solo breaks.
College  proved  a  training  ground  for  Berry  the bandsman,  as  he  teamed  up  with  a  
number  of  amateur outfits.  He never  played  simply  to show  off. Instead,  he tried  to bring 
out the positive  attributes  in any given sit-
uation  or setting.  Later,  when  Berry  is  performing  with the  Calloway  ensemble,  we  
hear  some  ragged,  out-of- tune  playing  until  Berry’s  first  few  solo  notes  emerge.

The  other  players,  no longer  languidly  blowing  through their  charts,  immediately   surge  
up  behind   him,  all
fighting-fit.  Once  Berry  finishes  his  solo,  the  shenani- gans resume.

After making his way  to New  York, Berry  immedi- ately  became  a  presence  and  soon  was  in  
demand.  The great  jazz  orchestras  of  the  swing  era  were  fronted  by
musical  directors/arrangers—Duke  Ellington  was  pre- eminent—who  drew  the  acclaim.  The  
sidemen  were musical  traveling  s alesmen  who  sold  someone  else's wares  in  the  best  style 
 they  could  manage.  It  was  with Fletcher  Henderson  that  Berry  began  to  ditch  some  of
the   sideman's   subservient   trappings.   For   starters, Henderson  wrote  in  keys  that  
were  rare  for  the  jazz orchestras  of  the  day,  and  his  somber,  indigo-infected voicings  
were ideal for a player of  Berry’s introspective approach  to  his  instrument:  Berry  sounds  as 
 if  he's
being  swallowed  by  his  sax.  “Blues  in  C Sharp  Minor,” for  instance,  is  odd,  
haunting,  and  ultimately  relaxing. A  Berry  solo  in  it  is  slightly  off  mike,  making  the 
 lis- tener  feel  as  though  he's  been  playing  for  some  time before  we  finally  hear  him. 
 The  effect  is  unnerving,  as
if  we weren't  paying close attention.

In June 1940, Cab Calloway  granted  Berry a show- case  piece,  “A  Ghost  of  a  Chance,”  the  
sole  recording in  Berry's  career  to  feature  him  from  start  to  finish.  It was   his   
“Body   and   Sou1,”   a   response   to  Coleman
Hawkins’s  famous  recording,  intended  not  as  a  riposte to a  rival,  but  as  the other  
half  of  a dialogue.  Its  rubato lines  are  disembodied  from  the  music  meant  to accom- pany 
 it,  which  is  spartan  to  begin  with.  This  may  be Berry's   one  and   only   instance   of 
  indulgence   on   a
record,  a  cathedral  of  a  solo  in  its  flourishes,  angles, ornamentations,  reflexivity. 
  If   sunlight   could   pass through  music,  “A  Ghost  of  a Chance”  would  funnel  it out in 
the broadest  spectrum  of  colors.
